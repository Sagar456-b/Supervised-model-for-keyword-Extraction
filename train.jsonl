The objective of the H\/sub 2\/ optimization is to reduce the total vibration energy of the system for overall frequencies; the total area under the power spectrum response curve is minimized in this criterion.

{"id":"639","title":"Distributed servers approach for large-scale secure multicast","abstract":"In order to offer backward and forward secrecy for multicast applications (i.e., a new member cannot decrypt the multicast data sent before its joining and a former member cannot decrypt the data sent after its leaving), the data encryption key has to be changed whenever a user joins or leaves the system. Such a change has to be made known to all the current users. The bandwidth used for such re-key messaging can be high when the user pool is large. We propose a distributed servers approach to minimize the overall system bandwidth (and complexity) by splitting the user pool into multiple groups each served by a (logical) server. After presenting an analytic model for the system based on a hierarchical key tree, we show that there is an optimal number of servers to achieve minimum system bandwidth. As the underlying user traffic fluctuates, we propose a simple dynamic scheme with low overhead where a physical server adaptively splits and merges its traffic into multiple groups each served by a logical server so as to minimize its total bandwidth.

This sequence provides an effective tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution and reduces image distortion and signal dropout. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)-weighted fMRI signal can be reliably obtained in the region of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). To overcome physiological motion artifacts during prolonged multisegment EPI acquisition, two sets of navigator echoes were acquired in both the readout and phase-encoding directions. Ghost artifacts generally produced by single-shot EPI acquisition were eliminated by separately placing the even and odd echoes in different k-space trajectories. Unlike most z-shim methods that focus on increasing temporal resolution for event-related functional brain mapping, the MESBAC sequence simultaneously addresses problems of image distortion and signal dropout while maintaining sufficient temporal resolution.

{"id":"1150","title":"Effect of multileaf collimator leaf width on physical dose distributions in the treatment of CNS and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy","abstract":"The purpose of this work is to examine physical radiation dose differences between two multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf widths (5 and 10 mm) in the treatment of CNS and head and neck neoplasms with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Three clinical patients with CNS tumors were planned with two different MLC leaf sizes, 5 and 10 mm, representing Varian-120 and Varian-80 Millennium multileaf collimators, respectively. Two sets of IMRT treatment plans were developed. The goal of the first set was radiation dose conformality in three dimensions. The goal for the second set was organ avoidance of a nearby critical structure while maintaining adequate coverage of the target volume. Treatment planning utilized the CadPlan\/Helios system (Varian Medical Systems, Milpitas CA) for dynamic MLC treatment delivery. All beam parameters and optimization (cost function) parameters were identical for the 5 and 10 mm plans. For all cases the number of beams, gantry positions, and table positions were taken from clinically treated three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy plans. Conformality was measured by the ratio of the planning isodose volume to the target volume. Organ avoidance was measured by the volume of the critical structure receiving greater than 90% of the prescription dose (V\/sub 90\/). For three patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (T2-T4 N0-N2c M0) 5 and 10 mm leaf widths were compared for parotid preservation utilizing nine coplanar equally spaced beams delivering a simultaneous integrated boost. Because modest differences in physical dose to the parotid were detected, a NTCP model based upon the clinical parameters of Eisbruch et al. was then used for comparisons. The conformality improved in all three CNS cases for the 5 mm plans compared to the 10 mm plans. For the organ avoidance plans, V\/sub 90\/ also improved in two of the three cases when the 5 mm leaf width was utilized for IMRT treatment delivery. In the third case, both the 5 and 10 mm plans were able to spare the critical structure with none of the structure receiving more than 90% of the prescription dose, but in the moderate dose range, less dose was delivered to the critical structure with the 5 mm plan. For the head and neck cases both the 5 and 10*2.5 mm beamlets dMLC sliding window techniques spared the contralateral parotid gland while maintaining target volume coverage. The mean parotid dose was modestly lower with the smaller beamlet size (21.04 Gy vs 22.36 Gy). The resulting average NTCP values were 13.72% for 10 mm dMLC and 8.24% for 5 mm dMLC. In conclusion, five mm leaf width results in an improvement in physical dose distribution over 10 mm leaf width that may be clinically relevant in some cases. These differences may be most pronounced for single fraction radiosurgery or in cases where the tolerance of the sensitive organ is less than or close to the target volume prescription","tok_text":"effect of multileaf collim leaf width on physic dose distribut in the treatment of cn and head and neck neoplasm with intens modul radiat therapi \n the purpos of thi work is to examin physic radiat dose differ between two multileaf collim ( mlc ) leaf width ( 5 and 10 mm ) in the treatment of cn and head and neck neoplasm with intens modul radiat therapi ( imrt ) . three clinic patient with cn tumor were plan with two differ mlc leaf size , 5 and 10 mm , repres varian-120 and varian-80 millennium multileaf collim , respect . two set of imrt treatment plan were develop . the goal of the first set wa radiat dose conform in three dimens . the goal for the second set wa organ avoid of a nearbi critic structur while maintain adequ coverag of the target volum . treatment plan util the cadplan \/ helio system ( varian medic system , milpita ca ) for dynam mlc treatment deliveri . all beam paramet and optim ( cost function ) paramet were ident for the 5 and 10 mm plan . for all case the number of beam , gantri posit , and tabl posit were taken from clinic treat three-dimension conform radiotherapi plan . conform wa measur by the ratio of the plan isodos volum to the target volum . organ avoid wa measur by the volum of the critic structur receiv greater than 90 % of the prescript dose ( v \/ sub 90\/ ) . for three patient with squamou cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( t2-t4 n0-n2c m0 ) 5 and 10 mm leaf width were compar for parotid preserv util nine coplanar equal space beam deliv a simultan integr boost . becaus modest differ in physic dose to the parotid were detect , a ntcp model base upon the clinic paramet of eisbruch et al . wa then use for comparison . the conform improv in all three cn case for the 5 mm plan compar to the 10 mm plan . for the organ avoid plan , v \/ sub 90\/ also improv in two of the three case when the 5 mm leaf width wa util for imrt treatment deliveri . in the third case , both the 5 and 10 mm plan were abl to spare the critic structur with none of the structur receiv more than 90 % of the prescript dose , but in the moder dose rang , less dose wa deliv to the critic structur with the 5 mm plan . for the head and neck case both the 5 and 10 * 2.5 mm beamlet dmlc slide window techniqu spare the contralater parotid gland while maintain target volum coverag . the mean parotid dose wa modestli lower with the smaller beamlet size ( 21.04 gy vs 22.36 gy ) . the result averag ntcp valu were 13.72 % for 10 mm dmlc and 8.24 % for 5 mm dmlc . in conclus , five mm leaf width result in an improv in physic dose distribut over 10 mm leaf width that may be clinic relev in some case . these differ may be most pronounc for singl fraction radiosurgeri or in case where the toler of the sensit organ is less than or close to the target volum prescript","ordered_present_kp":[10,41,90,118,394,547,1440,1085,2672,2372,1728,266,2387,2399],"keyphrases":["multileaf collimator leaf width","physical dose distributions","head and neck neoplasms","intensity modulated radiation therapy","10 mm","CNS tumors","treatment planning","conformal radiotherapy","parotid preservation","5 mm","beamlet size","21.04 Gy","22.36 Gy","single fraction radiosurgery","CNS neoplasms","optimization parameters","acceptable tumor coverage","minimal toxicity","collimator rotation"],"prmu":["P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","R","R","M","U","M"]}

The two main parts of this system are: (1) iterative tool design based on thermal and structural models; and (2) fabrication of the tool using a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software and abrasive water jet cutting. CAM software has been developed to take lamination slice data (profiles) from any proprietary RP software in the form of polylines and create smooth, kinematically desirable cutting trajectories for each tool lamination. Two cutting trajectory algorithms, called identical equidistant profile segmentation and adaptively vector profiles projection (AVPP), were created for this purpose.

In such sequences, a particular item may occur more than once or the sequence may share states with another sequence. Processing of repeated\/shared states is a hard problem that occurs very often in the domain of robotics. The proposed model consists of two groups of synaptic weights: competitive interlayer and Hebbian intralayer connections, which are responsible for encoding respectively the spatial and temporal features of the input sequence.

Recency is found in the 'going concern' judgments of staff auditors, but is successfully eliminated by the auditor's use of a simple self-review technique that would be extremely easy to implement in audit practice. Auditors who self-review are also less inclined to make audit report choices that are inconsistent with their going concern judgments. These results are important because the judgments of staff auditors often determine the type and extent of documentation in audit workpapers and serve as preliminary inputs for senior auditors' judgments and choices. If staff auditors' judgments are affected by recency, the impact of this bias may be impounded in the ultimate judgments and choices of senior auditors. Since biased judgments can expose auditors to significant costs involving extended audit procedures, legal liability and diminished reputation, simple debiasing techniques that reduce this exposure are valuable.

It accommodates a variety of source signals (including both music and speech) with different sampling rates. It is based on separating irrelevance and redundancy reductions into independent functional units. This contrasts traditional audio coding where both are integrated within the same subband decomposition. The separation allows for the independent optimization of the irrelevance and redundancy reduction units. For both reductions, we rely on adaptive filtering and predictive coding as much as possible to minimize the delay. A psycho-acoustically controlled adaptive linear filter is used for the irrelevance reduction, and the redundancy reduction is carried out by a predictive lossless coding scheme, which is termed weighted cascaded least mean squared (WCLMS) method. Experiments are carried out on a database of moderate size which contains mono-signals of different sampling rates and varying nature (music, speech, or mixed). They show that the proposed WCLMS lossless coder outperforms other competing lossless coders in terms of compression ratios and delay, as applied to the pre-filtered signal.

One of the most promising active rotorcraft vibration control systems is an active trailing edge flap. In this paper, an induced-shear piezoelectric tube actuator is used in conjunction with a simple lever-cusp hinge amplification device to generate a useful combination of trailing edge flap deflections and hinge moments. A finite-element model of the actuator tube and trailing edge flap (including aerodynamic and inertial loading) was used to guide the design of the actuator-flap system. A full-scale induced shear tube actuator flap system was fabricated and bench top testing was conducted to validate the analysis. Hinge moments corresponding to various rotor speeds were applied to the actuator using mechanical springs. The testing demonstrated that for an applied electric field of 3 kV cm\/sup -1\/ the tube actuator deflected a representative full-scale 12 inch flap +or-2.8 degrees at 0 rpm and +or-1.4 degrees for a hinge moment simulating a 400 rpm condition. The per cent error between the predicted and experimental full-scale flap deflections ranged from 4% (low rpm) to 12.5% (large rpm). Increasing the electric field to 4 kV cm\/sup -1\/ results in +or-2.5 degrees flap deflection at a rotation speed of 400 rpm, according to the design analysis.

In order to get a finite state space, a new method called strand-added on demand is exploited, which extends a bundle in an incremental manner without requiring explicit configuration of protocol execution parameters.

{"id":"1152","title":"Incorporating multi-leaf collimator leaf sequencing into iterative IMRT optimization","abstract":"Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning typically considers beam optimization and beam delivery as separate tasks. Following optimization, a multi-leaf collimator (MLC) or other beam delivery device is used to generate fluence patterns for patient treatment delivery. Due to limitations and characteristics of the MLC, the deliverable intensity distributions often differ from those produced by the optimizer, leading to differences between the delivered and the optimized doses. Objective function parameters are then adjusted empirically, and the plan is reoptimized to achieve a desired deliverable dose distribution. The resulting plan, though usually acceptable, may not be the best achievable. A method has been developed to incorporate the MLC restrictions into the optimization process. Our in-house IMRT system has been modified to include the calculation of the deliverable intensity into the optimizer. In this process, prior to dose calculation, the MLC leaf sequencer is used to convert intensities to dynamic MLC sequences, from which the deliverable intensities are then determined. All other optimization steps remain the same. To evaluate the effectiveness of deliverable-based optimization, 17 patient cases have been studied. Compared with standard optimization plus conversion to deliverable beams, deliverable-based optimization results show improved isodose coverage and a reduced dose to critical structures. Deliverable-based optimization results are close to the original nondeliverable optimization results, suggesting that IMRT can overcome the MLC limitations by adjusting individual beamlets. The use of deliverable-based optimization may reduce the need for empirical adjustment of objective function parameters and reoptimization of a plan to achieve desired results","tok_text":"incorpor multi-leaf collim leaf sequenc into iter imrt optim \n intens modul radiat therapi ( imrt ) treatment plan typic consid beam optim and beam deliveri as separ task . follow optim , a multi-leaf collim ( mlc ) or other beam deliveri devic is use to gener fluenc pattern for patient treatment deliveri . due to limit and characterist of the mlc , the deliver intens distribut often differ from those produc by the optim , lead to differ between the deliv and the optim dose . object function paramet are then adjust empir , and the plan is reoptim to achiev a desir deliver dose distribut . the result plan , though usual accept , may not be the best achiev . a method ha been develop to incorpor the mlc restrict into the optim process . our in-hous imrt system ha been modifi to includ the calcul of the deliver intens into the optim . in thi process , prior to dose calcul , the mlc leaf sequenc is use to convert intens to dynam mlc sequenc , from which the deliver intens are then determin . all other optim step remain the same . to evalu the effect of deliverable-bas optim , 17 patient case have been studi . compar with standard optim plu convers to deliver beam , deliverable-bas optim result show improv isodos coverag and a reduc dose to critic structur . deliverable-bas optim result are close to the origin nondeliver optim result , suggest that imrt can overcom the mlc limit by adjust individu beamlet . the use of deliverable-bas optim may reduc the need for empir adjust of object function paramet and reoptim of a plan to achiev desir result","ordered_present_kp":[63,100,143,128,261,481,571,1481],"keyphrases":["intensity modulated radiation therapy","treatment planning","beam optimization","beam delivery","fluence patterns","objective function parameters","deliverable dose distribution","empirical adjustment","iterative optimization","multileaf collimator leaf sequencing","tumor dose","optimized intensity","gradient-based search algorithm","beamlet ray intensities","Newton method","dose-volume objective values"],"prmu":["P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","R","M","M","R","U","M","M","M"]}

{"id":"643","title":"Time-resolved contrast-enhanced imaging with isotropic resolution and broad coverage using an undersampled 3D projection trajectory","abstract":"Time-resolved contrast-enhanced 3D MR angiography (MRA) methods have gained in popularity but are still limited by the tradeoff between spatial and temporal resolution. A method is presented that greatly reduces this tradeoff by employing undersampled 3D projection reconstruction trajectories. The variable density k-space sampling intrinsic to this sequence is combined with temporal k-space interpolation to provide time frames as short as 4 s. This time resolution reduces the need for exact contrast timing while also providing dynamic information. Spatial resolution is determined primarily by the projection readout resolution and is thus isotropic across the FOV, which is also isotropic.

In similar case retrieval, multiple indices are set up in order to characterize the queries and individual cases, then terms are given as values to each. The similarity measure between cases commonly used is defined using the rate at which the values provided from the corresponding indices match. In practice, however, values cannot be expected to be mutually exclusive. As a result, a natural expansion of this approach is to have relationships in which mutually similar meanings are reflected in the similarity measure between cases. In this paper the authors consider an auto-fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between corresponding indices and a cross-fuzzy thesaurus which gives the relationship for values between mutually distinct indices, then defines a similarity measure between cases which considers the relationship of index values based on these thesauri.

The subjects consisted of 12 patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma and 9 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) who were treated with radical radiotherapy between July 1999 and February 2001. Image fusion between \/sup 18\/FDG-PET and MRI\/CT was performed using an automatic multimodality image registration algorithm, which used the brain as an internal reference for registration. Gross tumor volume (GTV) was determined based on clinical examination and \/sup 18\/FDG uptake on the fusion images. Clinical target volume (CTV) was determined following the usual pattern of lymph node spread for each disease entity along with the clinical presentation of each patient. Except for 3 cases with superficial tumors, all the other primary tumors were detected by \/sup 18\/FDG-PET. The GTV volumes for primary tumors were not changed by image fusion in 19 cases (89%), increased by 49% in one NPC, and decreased by 45% in another NPC.

These noise nonuniformities can affect low-contrast object detectability and have also been identified as the cause of the zebra artifacts that plague maximum intensity projection (MIP) images of such volumes. While these spatially variant noise levels have their root in the peculiarities of the helical scan geometry, there is also a strong dependence on the interpolation and reconstruction algorithms employed. In this paper, we seek to develop image reconstruction strategies that eliminate or reduce, at its source, the nonuniformity of noise levels in helical CT relative to that in conventional CT. We pursue two approaches, independently and in concert. We argue, and verify, that Fourier-based longitudinal interpolation approaches lead to more uniform noise ratios than do the standard 360LI and 180LI approaches.

{"id":"991","title":"Estimation of blocking probabilities in cellular networks with dynamic channel assignment","abstract":"Blocking probabilities in cellular mobile communication networks using dynamic channel assignment are hard to compute for realistic sized systems. This computational difficulty is due to the structure of the state space, which imposes strong coupling constraints amongst components of the occupancy vector. Approximate tractable models have been proposed, which have product form stationary state distributions. However, for real channel assignment schemes, the product form is a poor approximation and it is necessary to simulate the actual occupancy process in order to estimate the blocking probabilities. Meaningful estimates of the blocking probability typically require an enormous amount of CPU time for simulation, since blocking events are usually rare. Advanced simulation approaches use importance sampling (IS) to overcome this problem. We study two regimes under which blocking is a rare event: low-load and high cell capacity. Our simulations use the standard clock (SC) method. For low load, we propose a change of measure that we call static ISSC, which has bounded relative error. For high capacity, we use a change of measure that depends on the current state of the network occupancy. This is the dynamic ISSC method.

{"id":"586","title":"A strategy for a payoff-switching differential game based on fuzzy reasoning","abstract":"In this paper, a new concept of a payoff-switching differential game is introduced. In this new game, any one player at any time may have several choices of payoffs for the future. Moreover, the payoff-switching process, including the time of payoff switching and the outcome payoff, of any one player is unknown to the other. Indeed, the overall payoff, which is a sequence of several payoffs, is unknown until the game ends. An algorithm for determining a reasoning strategy based on fuzzy reasoning is proposed. In this algorithm, the fuzzy theory is used to estimate the behavior of one player during a past time interval. By deriving two fuzzy matrices GSM, game similarity matrix, and VGSM, variation of GSM, the behavior of the player can be quantified. Two weighting vectors are selected to weight the relative importance of the player's behavior at each past time instant. Finally a simple fuzzy inference rule is adopted to generate a linear reasoning strategy. The advantage of this algorithm is that it provides a flexible way for differential game specialists to convert their knowledge into a \"reasonable\" strategy.

{"id":"1196","title":"Multiple shooting using a dichotomically stable integrator for solving differential-algebraic equations","abstract":"In previous work by the first author, it has been established that a dichotomically stable discretization is needed when solving a stiff boundary-value problem in ordinary differential equations (ODEs), when sharp boundary layers may occur at each end of the interval. A dichotomically stable implicit Runge-Kutta method, using the 3-stage, fourth-order, Lobatto IIIA formulae, has been implemented in a variable step-size initial-value integrator, which could be used in a multiple-shooting approach. In the case of index-one differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) the use of the Lobatto IIIA formulae has an advantage, over a comparable Gaussian method, that the order is the same for both differential and algebraic variables, and there is no need to treat them separately. The ODE integrator has been adapted for the solution of index-one DAEs, and the resulting integrator (SYMDAE) has been inserted into the multiple-shooting code (MSHDAE) previously developed by R. Lamour for differential-algebraic boundary-value problems. The standard version of MSHDAE uses a BDF integrator, which is not dichotomically stable, and for some stiff test problems this fails to integrate across the interval of interest, while the dichotomically stable integrator SYMDAE encounters no difficulty. Indeed, for such problems, the modified version of MSHDAE produces an accurate solution, and within limits imposed by computer word length, the efficiency of the solution process improves with increasing stiffness.

We point out that streams can be classified not only by lifetime (dragonflies and tortoises) but also by size (mice and elephants), and note that stream size and lifetime are independent dimensions. We submit that ISPs need to be aware of the distribution of Internet stream sizes, and the impact of the difference in behavior between short and long streams. In particular, any forwarding cache mechanisms in Internet routers must be able to cope with a high volume of short streams.

The ride quality of a conventional stretcher and an assistant driver's seat is also compared. Braking during ambulance transportation generates negative foot-to-head acceleration in patients and causes blood pressure to rise in the patient's head. The ACS absorbs the foot-to-head acceleration by changing the angle of the stretcher, thus reducing the blood pressure variation. However, the ride quality of the ACS should be investigated further because the movement of the ACS may cause motion sickness and nausea. Experiments of ambulance transportation, including rapid acceleration and deceleration, are performed to evaluate the effect of differences in posture of the transported subject on the ride quality; the semantic differential method and factor analysis are used in the investigations. Subjects are transported using a conventional stretcher with head forward, a conventional stretcher with head backward, the ACS, and an assistant driver's seat for comparison with transportation using a stretcher. Experimental results show that the ACS gives the most comfortable transportation when using a stretcher. Moreover, the reduction of the negative foot-to-head acceleration at frequencies below 0.2 Hz and the small variation of the foot-to-head acceleration result in more comfortable transportation.

{"id":"1273","title":"Towards an ontology of approximate reason","abstract":"This article introduces structural aspects in an ontology of approximate reason. The basic assumption in this ontology is that approximate reason is a capability of an agent. Agents are designed to classify information granules derived from sensors that respond to stimuli in the environment of an agent or received from other agents. Classification of information granules is carried out in the context of parameterized approximation spaces and a calculus of granules. Judgment in agents is a faculty of thinking about (classifying) the particular relative to decision rules derived from data. Judgment in agents is reflective, but not in the classical philosophical sense (e.g., the notion of judgment in Kant). In an agent, a reflective judgment itself is an assertion that a particular decision rule derived from data is applicable to an object (input). That is, a reflective judgment by an agent is an assertion that a particular vector of attribute (sensor) values matches to some degree the conditions for a particular rule. In effect, this form of judgment is an assertion that a vector of sensor values reflects a known property of data expressed by a decision rule. Since the reasoning underlying a reflective judgment is inductive and surjective (not based on a priori conditions or universals), this form of judgment is reflective, but not in the sense of Kant. Unlike Kant, a reflective judgment is surjective in the sense that it maps experimental attribute values onto the most closely matching descriptors (conditions) in a derived rule. Again, unlike Kant's notion of judgment, a reflective judgment is not the result of searching for a universal that pertains to a particular set of values of descriptors.

{"id":"626","title":"Approximate confidence intervals for one proportion and difference of two proportions","abstract":"Constructing a confidence interval for a binomial proportion or the difference of two proportions is a routine exercise in daily data analysis. The best-known method is the Wald interval based on the asymptotic normal approximation to the distribution of the observed sample proportion, though it is known to have bad performance for small to medium sample sizes. Agresti et al. (1998, 2000) proposed an Adding-4 method: 4 pseudo-observations are added with 2 successes and 2 failures and then the resulting (pseudo-)sample proportion is used. The method is simple and performs extremely well. Here we propose an approximate method based on a t-approximation that takes account of the uncertainty in estimating the variance of the observed (pseudo-)sample proportion. It follows the same line of using a t-test, rather than z-test, in testing the mean of a normal distribution with an unknown variance.

{"id":"59","title":"Efficient tracking of the cross-correlation coefficient","abstract":"In many (audio) processing algorithms, involving manipulation of discrete-time signals, the performance can vary strongly over the repertoire that is used. This may be the case when the signals from the various channels are allowed to be strongly positively or negatively correlated. We propose and analyze a general formula for tracking the (time-dependent) correlation between two signals. Some special cases of this formula lead to classical results known from the literature, others are new. This formula is recursive in nature, and uses only the instantaneous values of the two signals, in a low-cost and low-complexity manner; in particular, there is no need to take square roots or to carry out divisions. Furthermore, this formula can be modified with respect to the occurrence of the two signals so as to further decrease the complexity, and increase ease of implementation. The latter modification comes at the expense that not the actual correlation is tracked, but, rather, a somewhat deformed version of it. To overcome this problem, we propose, for a number of instances of the tracking formula, a simple warping operation on the deformed correlation. Now we obtain, at least for sinusoidal signals, the correct value of the correlation coefficient. Special attention is paid to the convergence behavior of the algorithm for stationary signals and the dynamic behavior if there is a transition to another stationary state; the latter is considered to be important to study the tracking abilities to nonstationary signals. We illustrate tracking algorithm by using it for stereo music fragments, obtained from a number of digital audio recordings","tok_text":"effici track of the cross-correl coeffici \n in mani ( audio ) process algorithm , involv manipul of discrete-tim signal , the perform can vari strongli over the repertoir that is use . thi may be the case when the signal from the variou channel are allow to be strongli posit or neg correl . we propos and analyz a gener formula for track the ( time-depend ) correl between two signal . some special case of thi formula lead to classic result known from the literatur , other are new . thi formula is recurs in natur , and use onli the instantan valu of the two signal , in a low-cost and low-complex manner ; in particular , there is no need to take squar root or to carri out divis . furthermor , thi formula can be modifi with respect to the occurr of the two signal so as to further decreas the complex , and increas eas of implement . the latter modif come at the expens that not the actual correl is track , but , rather , a somewhat deform version of it . to overcom thi problem , we propos , for a number of instanc of the track formula , a simpl warp oper on the deform correl . now we obtain , at least for sinusoid signal , the correct valu of the correl coeffici . special attent is paid to the converg behavior of the algorithm for stationari signal and the dynam behavior if there is a transit to anoth stationari state ; the latter is consid to be import to studi the track abil to nonstationari signal . we illustr track algorithm by use it for stereo music fragment , obtain from a number of digit audio record","ordered_present_kp":[0,20,100,1055,1072,1117,1207,1245,1271,1317,1397,1431,1461,1509],"keyphrases":["efficient tracking","cross-correlation coefficient","discrete-time signals","warping operation","deformed correlation","sinusoidal signals","convergence behavior","stationary signals","dynamic behavior","stationary state","nonstationary signals","tracking algorithm","stereo music fragments","digital audio recording","audio processing algorithms","time-dependent correlation","recursive formula"],"prmu":["P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","R","R","R"]}

{"id":"1441","title":"Handles and exception safety, Part 1. A simple handle class","abstract":"Every C++ program that uses inheritance must manage memory somehow. The most obvious way to do so is directly, but programmers who create complicated data structures often have trouble figuring out what parts of those data structures are safe to delete when. The classical method of dealing with such complexity is to hide it in a class. Such classes are typically called handles; the idea is to attach a handle object to another object that contains the actual data. The simplest form of a handle, which we have discussed in this article, is one in which each handle object corresponds to a single object from the inheritance hierarchy. Such handles are straightforward to use and to implement and tend to be intrinsically exception safe in almost all respects. The one exception hazard in such a class is typically the assignment operator. Assignment operators often test for self-assignment to avoid aliasing problems. As Herb Sutter has observed (2000), programs that need such tests are almost always exception unsafe. By rewriting the assignment operator, we ensure that we do not do anything irrevocable until the possibility of throwing an exception has passed. This strategy ensures that if an exception occurs while our assignment operator is executing, we do not corrupt the rest of our system","tok_text":"handl and except safeti , part 1 . a simpl handl class \n everi c++ program that use inherit must manag memori somehow . the most obviou way to do so is directli , but programm who creat complic data structur often have troubl figur out what part of those data structur are safe to delet when . the classic method of deal with such complex is to hide it in a class . such class are typic call handl ; the idea is to attach a handl object to anoth object that contain the actual data . the simplest form of a handl , which we have discuss in thi articl , is one in which each handl object correspond to a singl object from the inherit hierarchi . such handl are straightforward to use and to implement and tend to be intrins except safe in almost all respect . the one except hazard in such a class is typic the assign oper . assign oper often test for self-assign to avoid alias problem . as herb sutter ha observ ( 2000 ) , program that need such test are almost alway except unsaf . by rewrit the assign oper , we ensur that we do not do anyth irrevoc until the possibl of throw an except ha pass . thi strategi ensur that if an except occur while our assign oper is execut , we do not corrupt the rest of our system","ordered_present_kp":[0,810,851,872,10,63,625],"keyphrases":["handles","exception","C++ program","inheritance hierarchy","assignment operator","self-assignment","aliasing problems"],"prmu":["P","P","P","P","P","P","P"]}

Unfortunately, it is hard to obtain high performance on the latter architecture, particularly when large numbers of threads are involved. In this paper, we discuss the difficulties faced when writing OpenMP programs for ccNUMA systems, and explain how the vendors have attempted to overcome them. We focus on one such system, the SGI Origin 2000, and perform a variety of experiments designed to illustrate the impact of the vendor's efforts. We compare codes written in a standard, loop-level parallel style under OpenMP with alternative versions written in a Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) fashion, also realized via OpenMP, and show that the latter consistently provides superior performance. A carefully chosen set of language extensions can help us translate programs from the former style to the latter (or to compile directly, but in a similar manner). Syntax for these extensions can be borrowed from HPF, and some aspects of HPF compiler technology can help the translation process.

{"id":"624","title":"A hybrid ML-EM algorithm for calculation of maximum likelihood estimates in semiparametric shared frailty models","abstract":"This paper describes a generalised hybrid ML-EM algorithm for the calculation of maximum likelihood estimates in semiparametric shared frailty models, the Cox proportional hazard models with hazard functions multiplied by a (parametric) frailty random variable. This hybrid method is much faster than the standard EM method and faster than the standard direct maximum likelihood method (ML, Newton-Raphson) for large samples. We have previously applied this method to semiparametric shared gamma frailty models, and verified by simulations the asymptotic and small sample statistical properties of the frailty variance estimates. Let theta \/sub 0\/ be the true value of the frailty variance parameter. Then the asymptotic distribution is normal for theta \/sub 0\/>0 while it is a 50-50 mixture between a point mass at zero and a normal random variable on the positive axis for theta \/sub 0\/=0.

Two versions of a digital maintenance manual were developed, the difference between them being the number of design heuristics observed when designing navigational aids. Neither version was based on an analysis of the tasks carried out by users, nor were users involved in the design process. Instead, the manuals were developed directly from the digital information used to produce the existing paper manual. Usability trials were carried out to test both versions according to the time taken and errors committed by users during typical information retrieval tasks. Users were questioned to determine their ease of use (EOU) perceptions for each manual. The main outcomes were that the navigation aid used in the second version reduced the time taken to use the manual but increased the number of errors made by users. The navigational aid also seemed to reduce the perceived EOU compared with the first version. In both cases, the perceived EOU was lower than for a previous digital manual that had been developed using a task analysis and user input.

{"id":"758","title":"Four-terminal quantum resistor network for electron-wave computing","abstract":"Interconnected ultrathin conducting wires or, equivalently, interconnected quasi-one-dimensional electron waveguides, which form a quantum resistor network, are presented here in four-terminal configurations. The transmission behaviors through such four-terminal networks are evaluated and classified. In addition, we show that such networks can be used as the basic building blocks for a possible massive wave computing machine in the future. In a network, each interconnection, a node point, is an elastic scatterer that routes the electron wave. Routing and rerouting of electron waves in a network is described in the framework of quantum transport from Landauer-Buttiker theory in the presence of multiple elastic scatterers. Transmissions through various types of four-terminal generalized clean Aharonov-Bohm rings are investigated at zero temperature. Useful logic functions are gathered based on the transmission probability to each terminal with the use of the Buttiker symmetry rule. In the generalized rings, even and odd numbers of terminals can possess some distinctly different transmission characteristics as we have shown here and earlier. Just as an even or odd number of atoms in a ring is an important quantity for classifying the transmission behavior, we show here that whether the number of terminals is an even or an odd number is just as important in understanding the physics of transmission through such a ring. Furthermore, we show that there are three basic classes of four-terminal rings and the scaling relation for each class is provided. In particular, the existence of equitransmission among all four terminals is shown here. This particular physical phenomena cannot exist in any three-terminal ring. Comparisons and discussions of transmission characteristics between three-terminal and four-terminal rings are also presented. The node-equation approach by considering the Kirchhoff current conservation law at each node point is used for this analysis. Many useful logic functions for electron-wave computing are shown here. In particular, we show that a full adder can be constructed very simply using the equitransmission property of the four-terminal ring.

The advantages of improvements must be weighed against those of compatibility. If compatibility considerations dominate, a grafting process takes place. According to our taxonomy of succession, there are three types of outcomes. A Type I succession, where grafting is successful, entails compatibility between successors, technical paradigm compliance and continuity in the standards trajectory. In this paper, we examine issues of succession and focus on the Extensible Markup Language (XML). It was to be grafted on the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a stable standard since 1988. However, XML was a profile, a subset and an extension of SGML (1988). Adaptation of SGML was needed (SGML 1999) to forge full (downward) compatibility with XML (1998). We describe the grafting efforts and analyze their outcomes. Our conclusion is that although SGML was a technical exemplar for XML developers, full compatibility was not achieved.

{"id":"1153","title":"Direct aperture optimization: A turnkey solution for step-and-shoot IMRT","abstract":"IMRT treatment plans for step-and-shoot delivery have traditionally been produced through the optimization of intensity distributions (or maps) for each beam angle. The optimization step is followed by the application of a leaf-sequencing algorithm that translates each intensity map into a set of deliverable aperture shapes. In this article, we introduce an automated planning system in which we bypass the traditional intensity optimization, and instead directly optimize the shapes and the weights of the apertures. We call this approach \"direct aperture optimization.\" This technique allows the user to specify the maximum number of apertures per beam direction, and hence provides significant control over the complexity of the treatment delivery. This is possible because the machine dependent delivery constraints imposed by the MLC are enforced within the aperture optimization algorithm rather than in a separate leaf-sequencing step. The leaf settings and the aperture intensities are optimized simultaneously using a simulated annealing algorithm. We have tested direct aperture optimization on a variety of patient cases using the EGS4\/BEAM Monte Carlo package for our dose calculation engine. The results demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can produce highly conformal step-and-shoot treatment plans using only three to five apertures per beam direction. As compared with traditional optimization strategies, our studies demonstrate that direct aperture optimization can result in a significant reduction in both the number of beam segments and the number of monitor units.

The recurrent neural network (RNN) type is used for such a purpose. Contrary to the programmable controller, an RNN-based sequential controller is based on a definite mathematical model rather than depending on the experience and trial and error techniques. The proposed controller is also more flexible because it is not limited by the restrictions of the finite state automata theory. Adequate guidelines of how to construct an RNN-based sequential controller are presented. These guidelines are applied to different case studies.

The resulting cooperative system called SIGIU is composed of a set of integrated operating systems (SYDEX) and the global planning and coordination system (SYGEC). The objective is to integrate the set of SYDEX and the SYGEC into a single coherent system for all the SIGIU's users according to their tasks, their roles, and their responsibilities within the municipal administration. SIGIU is provided by different measurement and monitoring instruments installed on some system's elements to be supervised. In this context, the information can be presented in different forms: video, pictures, data and alarms. One of SIGIU's objectives is the real-time management of urban infrastructures' control mechanisms. To carry out this process, the alarm control agent creates a mobile agent associated with the alarm, which is sent to a mobile station and warns an operator.

With the development of GIS and facilities management (FM) applications, SVEC decided this should be the basis for an information system that would model its physical plant and interface with its accounting and billing systems. It could add applications such as outage management, staking, line design and metering to use this information and interface with these databases. However, based on SVEC's size it was not feasible to implement a sophisticated and expensive GIS\/FM system. Over the past nine years, SVEC has had success with a building block approach, and its customers and employees are realizing the benefits of the automated applications.

In this problem, a fuzzy price is determined using a linear or a quadratic fuzzy demand function as well as a linear cost function. The objective is to find the optimal fuzzy profit, which is derived from the fuzzy price and fuzzy cost. Traditional methods for solving this problem are (1) the extension principle, and (2) using interval arithmetic and alpha -cuts. However, we argue that traditional methods for solving this problem are too restrictive to produce an optimal solution, and that an alternative approach is possibly needed. We use genetic algorithms to obtain an approximate solution for this fuzzy optimal profit problem without using membership functions. We not only give empirical examples to show the effectiveness of this approach, but also give theoretical proofs to validate correctness of the algorithm.

Today, the company supplies electricity to some 1.7 million inhabitants via 285000 connections. During 1999, the year the energy market was started in Germany, HEW needed to operate and maintain a safe and reliable network cheaply. The development and implementation of a distribution management system (DMS) is key to the success of HEW. HEW's strategy was to obtain efficient new software for network management that also offered a good platform for future applications. Following a pilot and prequalification phase, HEW invited several companies to process the requirements catalog and to submit a detailed tender.

{"id":"1151","title":"A method for geometrical verification of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy using a scanning electronic portal imaging device","abstract":"In order to guarantee the safe delivery of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), verification of the leaf trajectories during the treatment is necessary. Our aim in this study is to develop a method for on-line verification of leaf trajectories using an electronic portal imaging device with scanning read-out, independent of the multileaf collimator. Examples of such scanning imagers are electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) based on liquid-filled ionization chambers and those based on amorphous silicon. Portal images were acquired continuously with a liquid-filled ionization chamber EPID during the delivery, together with the signal of treatment progress that is generated by the accelerator. For each portal image, the prescribed leaf and diaphragm positions were computed from the dynamic prescription and the progress information. Motion distortion effects of the leaves are corrected based on the treatment progress that is recorded for each image row. The aperture formed by the prescribed leaves and diaphragms is used as the reference field edge, while the actual field edge is found using a maximum-gradient edge detector. The errors in leaf and diaphragm position are found from the deviations between the reference field edge and the detected field edge. Earlier measurements of the dynamic EPID response show that the accuracy of the detected field edge is better than 1 mm. To ensure that the verification is independent of inaccuracies in the acquired progress signal, the signal was checked with diode measurements beforehand. The method was tested on three different dynamic prescriptions. Using the described method, we correctly reproduced the distorted field edges. Verifying a single portal image took 0.1 s on an 866 MHz personal computer. Two flaws in the control system of our experimental dynamic multileaf collimator were correctly revealed with our method. First, the errors in leaf position increase with leaf speed, indicating a delay of approximately 0.8 s in the control system. Second, the accuracy of the leaves and diaphragms depends on the direction of motion. In conclusion, the described verification method is suitable for detailed verification of leaf trajectories during dynamic IMRT","tok_text":"a method for geometr verif of dynam intens modul radiotherapi use a scan electron portal imag devic \n in order to guarante the safe deliveri of dynam intens modul radiotherapi ( imrt ) , verif of the leaf trajectori dure the treatment is necessari . our aim in thi studi is to develop a method for on-lin verif of leaf trajectori use an electron portal imag devic with scan read-out , independ of the multileaf collim . exampl of such scan imag are electron portal imag devic ( epid ) base on liquid-fil ioniz chamber and those base on amorph silicon . portal imag were acquir continu with a liquid-fil ioniz chamber epid dure the deliveri , togeth with the signal of treatment progress that is gener by the acceler . for each portal imag , the prescrib leaf and diaphragm posit were comput from the dynam prescript and the progress inform . motion distort effect of the leav are correct base on the treatment progress that is record for each imag row . the apertur form by the prescrib leav and diaphragm is use as the refer field edg , while the actual field edg is found use a maximum-gradi edg detector . the error in leaf and diaphragm posit are found from the deviat between the refer field edg and the detect field edg . earlier measur of the dynam epid respons show that the accuraci of the detect field edg is better than 1 mm . to ensur that the verif is independ of inaccuraci in the acquir progress signal , the signal wa check with diod measur beforehand . the method wa test on three differ dynam prescript . use the describ method , we correctli reproduc the distort field edg . verifi a singl portal imag took 0.1 s on an 866 mhz person comput . two flaw in the control system of our experiment dynam multileaf collim were correctli reveal with our method . first , the error in leaf posit increas with leaf speed , indic a delay of approxim 0.8 s in the control system . second , the accuraci of the leav and diaphragm depend on the direct of motion . in conclus , the describ verif method is suitabl for detail verif of leaf trajectori dure dynam imrt","ordered_present_kp":[30,1711,127,200,298,369,493,1795,763,842,1020,1574,1678],"keyphrases":["dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy","safe delivery","leaf trajectories","on-line verification","scanning read-out","liquid-filled ionization chambers","diaphragm positions","motion distortion effects","reference field edge","distorted field edges","control system","dynamic multileaf collimator","leaf positions","geometrical verification method","dose distributions","treatment planning"],"prmu":["P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","R","U","M"]}

In this work, a method using the Gaussian process for deconvolution (GPD) is proposed. The fact that the IRF is smooth is incorporated as a constraint in the method. The GPD method, which automatically estimates the noise level in each voxel, has the advantage that model parameters are optimized automatically. The GPD is compared to singular value decomposition (SVD) using a common threshold for the singular values, and to SVD using a threshold optimized according to the noise level in each voxel. The comparison is carried out using artificial data as well as data from healthy volunteers. It is shown that GPD is comparable to SVD with a variable optimized threshold when determining the maximum of the IRF, which is directly related to the perfusion. GPD provides a better estimate of the entire IRF. As the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases or the time resolution of the measurements increases, GPD is shown to be superior to SVD.

{"id":"913","title":"Control of a coupled map lattice model for vortex shedding in the wake of a cylinder","abstract":"The flow behind a vibrating flexible cable at low Reynolds numbers can exhibit complex wake structures such as lace-like patterns, vortex dislocations and frequency cells. These structures have been observed in experiments and numerical simulations, and are predicted by a previously developed low-order coupled map lattice (CML). The discrete (in time and space) CML models consist of a series of diffusively coupled circle map oscillators along the cable span. Motivated by a desire to modify the complex wake patterns behind flexible vibrating cables, we have studied the addition of control terms into the highly efficient CML models and explored the resulting dynamics. Proportional, adaptive proportional and discontinuous non-linear (DNL) control methods were used to derive the control laws. The first method employed occasional proportional feedback. The adaptive method used spatio-temporal feedback control. The DNL method used a discontinuous feedback linearization procedure, and the controller was designed for the resulting linearized system using eigenvalue assignment. These techniques were applied to a modeled vortex dislocation structure in the wake of a vibrating cable in uniform freestream flow. Parallel shedding patterns were achieved for a range of forcing frequency-forcing amplitude combinations studied to validate the control theory. The adaptive proportional and DNL methods were found to be more effective than the proportional control method due to the incorporation of a spatially varying feedback gain across the cylinder span. The DNL method was found to be the most efficient controller of the low-order CML model.

The reference values of particle shape and PSD for the NN fitting were based on image analysis.

The control system employs a preload relay (P_Relay) in series with a PID controller. The P_Relay ensures a high gain to yield a robust performance. However, it also incurs a chattering phenomenon. In this paper, instead of viewing the chattering as an undesirable yet inevitable feature, we use it as a naturally occurring signal for tuning and re-tuning the PID controller as the operating regime digresses.

Rational choice theory requires that participants should eventually allocate all their responses to the high-payoff alternative, but previous research has found that people fail to maximize their payoffs. Instead, it is commonly observed that people match their response probabilities to the payoff probabilities. We report three experiments on this choice anomaly using a simple probability learning task in which participants were provided with (i) large financial incentives, (ii) meaningful and regular feedback, and (iii) extensive training.

This method is adapted for practical application to solve problems in the area of condition monitoring and fault diagnosis where a number of fault signatures are involved. In these situations, the aim is health monitoring, including identification of deterioration of the healthy condition and identification of causes of the failure in real-time. For this reason a fault database is developed which contains the collected information about various states of operation of the system in the form of pattern vectors. The task of the real-time monitoring system is to correlate patterns of unknown faults with the known fault signatures in the fault database. This will determine cause of failure and degree of deterioration of the system under test.

{"id":"1175","title":"Prediction of tool and chip temperature in continuous and interrupted machining","abstract":"A numerical model based on the finite difference method is presented to predict tool and chip temperature fields in continuous machining and time varying milling processes. Continuous or steady state machining operations like orthogonal cutting are studied by modeling the heat transfer between the tool and chip at the tool-rake face contact zone. The shear energy created in the primary zone, the friction energy produced at the rake face-chip contact zone and the heat balance between the moving chip and stationary tool are considered.

For the feasibility problem, Farkas' lemma provides a characterization for general undirected graphs, asserting roughly that there exists such a flow if and only if the so-called distance inequality holds for every choice of distance functions arising from nonnegative node weights. For rings, this (straightforward) result will be improved in two ways. We prove that, independent of the integrality of node capacities, it suffices to require the distance inequality only for distances arising from (0-1-2)-valued node weights, a requirement that will be called the double-cut condition. Moreover, for integer-valued node capacities, the double-cut condition implies the existence of a half-integral multicommodity flow. In this case there is even an integer-valued multicommodity flow that violates each node capacity by at most one.

It provides the user with simple work-sharing directives while it relies on the compiler to generate parallel programs based on thread parallelism. However, the lack of language features for exploiting data locality often results in poor performance since the non-uniform memory access times on scalable SMP machines cannot be neglected. High Performance Fortran (HPF), the de-facto standard for data parallel programming, offers a rich set of data distribution directives in order to exploit data locality, but it has been mainly targeted towards distributed memory machines. In this paper we describe an optimized execution model for HPF programs on SMP machines that avails itself with mechanisms provided by OpenMP for work sharing and thread parallelism, while exploiting data locality based on user-specified distribution directives. Data locality does not only ensure that most memory accesses are close to the executing threads and are therefore faster, but it also minimizes synchronization overheads, especially in the case of unstructured reductions. The proposed shared memory execution model for HPF relies on a small set of language extensions, which resemble the OpenMP work-sharing features.

Over 90% of all the particles can be identified and located from the partially overlapped particle images using the circular Hough transform. Then the 3D position of each detected particle was determined by matching its front view image to its side view image.

These parameter-based frequency estimation methods can be applied to various engineering fields such as communications, radar and adaptive vibration and noise control. Well-known frequency estimation methods are introduced and explained. The Bairstow method is introduced to find the roots of a characteristic equation for estimations of multi-modal frequencies, and the computational efficiency of the Bairstow method is shown quantitatively. For a simple numerical test, we consider two sinusoids of the same amplitudes mixed with various amounts of white noise. The test results show that the auto regressive (AR) and auto regressive and moving average (ARMA) methods are unsuitable in noisy environments. The other methods apart from the AR method have fast tracking capability. From the point of view of computational efficiency, the results reveal that the ARMA method is inefficient, while the cascade notch filter method is very effective. The linearized adaptive notch filter and recursive maximum likelihood methods have average performances. Experimental tests are devised to confirm the feasibility of real-time computations and to impose the severe conditions of drastically different amplitudes and of considerable changes of natural frequencies. We have performed experiments to extract the natural frequencies from the vibration signal of wing-like composite plates in real time.

An important aspect of portable performance is the behavior of the available HPF compilers. Ideally, a programmer may expect comparable performance between different HPF compilers, given the same program and the same machine. To test the performance portability between compilers, we have designed a special benchmark suite, called the TNO HPF benchmark suite. It consists of a set of HPF programs that test various aspects of efficient parallel code generation. The benchmark suite consists of a number of template programs that are used to generate test programs with different array sizes, alignments, distributions, and iteration spaces. It ranges from very simple assignments to more complex assignments such as triangular iteration spaces, convex iteration spaces, coupled subscripts, and indirection arrays. We have run the TNO HPF benchmark suite on three compilers: the PREPARE prototype compiler, the PGI-HPF compiler, and the GMD Adaptor HPF compiler.

The technology used was Mondex, and its implementation was supported by all the country's major banks. It was launched with an extensive publicity campaign to promote Mondex not only in the domestic but also in the global market, for which the Canadian implementation was to serve as a \"showcase.\" However, soon after the start of the first field test it became apparent that the new technology did not work smoothly. On the contrary, it created a host of controversies, in areas as varied as computer security, consumer privacy, and monetary policy. In the following years, few of these controversies could be resolved and Mondex could not be established as a widely used payment mechanism. In 2001, the experiment was finally terminated. Using the concepts developed in recent science and technology studies (STS), the article analyzes these controversies as resulting from the difficulties of fitting electronic cash, a new sociotechnical system, into the complex setting of the existing payment system.

Therefore, improving the replication quality of land-groove or pit structure and reducing the birefringence distribution are emerging as important criteria in the fabrication of high-density optical disk substrates.

In reduced form, the model is shown to give results in accordance with literature. The properties of the baseline combination are explored using both linear and non-linear versions of the model. The influences of damping at the pintle joint and of several other design parameters on the stability of the linear system in the neighbourhood of the critical snaking speed are calculated and discussed. Coulomb friction damping at the pintle pin is then included and simulations are used to indicate the consequent amplitude-dependent behaviour. The friction damping, especially when its level has to be chosen by the user, is shown to give dangerous characteristics, despite having some capacity for stabilization of the snaking motions.

{"id":"1155","title":"A leaf sequencing algorithm to enlarge treatment field length in IMRT","abstract":"With MLC-based IMRT, the maximum usable field size is often smaller than the maximum field size for conventional treatments. This is due to the constraints of the overtravel distances of MLC leaves and\/or jaws. Using a new leaf sequencing algorithm, the usable IMRT field length (perpendicular to the MLC motion) can be mostly made equal to the full length of the MLC field without violating the upper jaw overtravel limit. For any given intensity pattern, a criterion was proposed to assess whether an intensity pattern can be delivered without violation of the jaw position constraints. If the criterion is met, the new algorithm will consider the jaw position constraints during the segmentation for the step and shoot delivery method. The strategy employed by the algorithm is to connect the intensity elements outside the jaw overtravel limits with those inside the jaw overtravel limits. Several methods were used to establish these connections during segmentation by modifying a previously published algorithm (areal algorithm), including changing the intensity level, alternating the leaf-sequencing direction, or limiting the segment field size. The algorithm was tested with 1000 random intensity patterns with dimensions of 21*27 cm\/sup 2\/, 800 intensity patterns with higher intensity outside the jaw overtravel limit, and three different types of clinical treatment plans that were undeliverable using a segmentation method from a commercial treatment planning system. The new algorithm achieved a success rate of 100% with these test patterns. For the 1000 random patterns, the new algorithm yields a similar average number of segments of 36.9+or-2.9 in comparison to 36.6+or-1.3 when using the areal algorithm. For the 800 patterns with higher intensities outside the jaw overtravel limits, the new algorithm results in an increase of 25% in the average number of segments compared to the areal algorithm. However, the areal algorithm fails to create deliverable segments for 90% of these patterns.

{"id":"644","title":"Three-dimensional spiral MR imaging: application to renal multiphase contrast-enhanced angiography","abstract":"A fast MR pulse sequence with spiral in-plane readout and conventional 3D partition encoding was developed for multiphase contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) of the renal vasculature. Compared to a standard multiphase 3D CE-MRA with FLASH readout, an isotropic in-plane spatial resolution of 1.4*1.4 mm\/sup 2\/ over 2.0*1.4 mm\/sup 2\/ could be achieved with a temporal resolution of 6 sec. The theoretical gain of spatial resolution by using the spiral pulse sequence and the performance in the presence of turbulent flow was evaluated in phantom measurements. Multiphase 3D CE-MRA of the renal arteries was performed in five healthy volunteers using both techniques. A deblurring technique was used to correct the spiral raw data. Thereby, the off-resonance frequencies were determined by minimizing the imaginary part of the data in image space.

The result shows that SPOT produces better DEM results in terms of accuracy and details, if the radiometric variations between the images, taken on subsequent satellite revolutions, are small. Otherwise, the ASTER stereo pair is a better choice because of simultaneous along-track acquisition during a single pass.

{"id":"917","title":"Efficient transitive closure reasoning in a combined class\/part\/containment hierarchy","abstract":"Class hierarchies form the backbone of many implemented knowledge representation and reasoning systems. They are used for inheritance, classification and transitive closure reasoning. Part hierarchies are also important in artificial intelligence. Other hierarchies, e.g. containment hierarchies, have received less attention in artificial intelligence. This paper presents an architecture and an implementation of a hierarchy reasoner that integrates a class hierarchy, a part hierarchy, and a containment hierarchy into one structure. In order to make an implemented reasoner useful, it needs to operate at least at speeds comparable to human reasoning. As real-world hierarchies are always large, special techniques need to be used to achieve this. We have developed a set of parallel algorithms and a data representation called maximally reduced tree cover for that purpose.

{"id":"870","title":"Speaker identification from voice using neural networks","abstract":"The paper provides three different schemes for speaker identification of personnel from their voice using artificial neural networks. The first scheme recognizes speakers by employing the classical backpropagation algorithm pre-trained with known voice samples of the persons. The second scheme provides a framework for classifying the known training samples of the voice features using a hierarchical architecture realized with a self-organizing feature map neural net. The first scheme is highly robust as it is capable of identifying the personnel from their noisy voice samples, but because of its excessive training time it has limited applications for a large voice database. The second scheme though not so robust as the former, however, can classify an unknown voice sample to its nearest class. The time needed for classification by the first scheme is always unique irrespective of the voice sample. It is proportional to the number of feedforward layers in the network.

Mainly, when values of attributes for a given customer, used in action rules, can not be easily changed by business user, definitions of these attributes are extracted from other sites of a distributed knowledge system. To be more precise, attributes at every site of a distributed knowledge system are divided into two sets: stable and flexible. Values of flexible attributes, for a given consumer, sometime can be changed and this change can be influenced and controlled by a business user. However, some of these changes (for instance to the attribute \"profit') can not be done directly to a chosen attribute. In this case, definitions of such an attribute in terms of other attributes have to be learned. These new definitions are used to construct action rules showing what changes in values of flexible attributes, for a given consumer, are needed in order to re-classify this consumer the way business user wants.

{"id":"58","title":"Robust speech recognition using probabilistic union models","abstract":"This paper introduces a new statistical approach, namely the probabilistic union model, for speech recognition involving partial, unknown frequency-band corruption. Partial frequency-band corruption accounts for the effect of a family of real-world noises. Previous methods based on the missing feature theory usually require the identity of the noisy bands. This identification can be difficult for unexpected noise with unknown, time-varying band characteristics. The new model combines the local frequency-band information based on the union of random events, to reduce the dependence of the model on information about the noise. This model partially accomplishes the target: offering robustness to partial frequency-band corruption, while requiring no information about the noise. This paper introduces the theory and implementation of the union model, and is focused on several important advances. These new developments include a new algorithm for automatic order selection, a generalization of the modeling principle to accommodate partial feature stream corruption, and a combination of the union model with conventional noise reduction techniques to deal with a mixture of stationary noise and unknown, nonstationary noise. For the evaluation, we used the TIDIGITS database for speaker-independent connected digit recognition. The utterances were corrupted by various types of additive noise, stationary or time-varying, assuming no knowledge about the noise characteristics.

Twenty solitary lung nodules smaller than 30 mm in diameter, including 10 lung cancers and 10 benign nodules, were used. The nodules were grouped subjectively according to their subtlety. For nonnodular cases, 20 nodules without perceptible interval changes were selected. All chest radiographs were obtained by using a computed radiographic system, and temporal subtraction images were produced by using a program developed at the University of Chicago. The effect of the temporal subtraction image was evaluated by using an observer performance study, with use of receiver operating characteristic analysis.

{"id":"1016","title":"A scalable model of cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing: the recurrent slide and latch (RSL) model","abstract":"From the dawn of modern neural network theory, the mammalian cerebellum has been a favored object of mathematical modeling studies. Early studies focused on the fanout, convergence, thresholding, and learned weighting of perceptual-motor signals within the cerebellar cortex. This led to the still viable idea that the granule cell stage in the cerebellar cortex performs a sparse expansive recoding of the time-varying input vector. This recoding reveals and emphasizes combinations in a distributed representation that serves as a basis for the learned, state-dependent control actions engendered by cerebellar outputs to movement related centers. To make optimal use of available signals, the cerebellum must be able to sift the evolving state representation for the most reliable predictors of the need for control actions, and to use those predictors even if they appear only transiently and well in advance of the optimal time for initiating the control action. The paper proposes a modification to prior, population, models for cerebellar adaptive timing and sequencing.

{"id":"1317","title":"Dynamic spectrum management for next-generation DSL systems","abstract":"The performance of DSL systems is severely constrained by crosstalk due to the electromagnetic coupling among the multiple twisted pairs making up a phone cable. In order to reduce performance loss arising from crosstalk, DSL systems are currently designed under the assumption of worst-case crosstalk scenarios leading to overly conservative DSL deployments. This article presents a new paradigm for DSL system design, which takes into account the multi-user aspects of the DSL transmission environment. Dynamic spectrum management (DSM) departs from the current design philosophy by enabling transceivers to autonomously and dynamically optimize their communication settings with respect to both the channel and the transmissions of neighboring systems. Along with this distributed optimization, when an additional degree of coordination becomes available for future DSL deployment, DSM will allow even greater improvement in DSL performance. Implementations are readily applicable without causing any performance degradation to the existing DSLs under static spectrum management. After providing an overview of the DSM concept, this article reviews two practical DSM methods: iterative water-filling, an autonomous distributed power control method enabling great improvement in performance, which can be implemented through software options in some existing ADSL and VDSL systems; and vectored-DMT, a coordinated transmission\/reception technique achieving crosstalk-free communication for DSL systems, which brings within reach the dream of providing universal Internet access at speeds close to 100 Mb\/s to 500 m on 1-2 lines and beyond 1 km on 2-4 lines.

The novelty of the technique is that the model's elastic parameters are not constant, but spatio-temporally varying. The variation of the elastic parameters depends on the distance of the model from the data and the rate of change of this distance. Each pass of the algorithm uses physics-based modeling techniques to iteratively adjust both the geometric and the elastic degrees of freedom of the model in response to forces that are computed from the discrepancy between the model and the data. By augmenting the state equations of an extended Kalman filter to incorporate these additional variables, we are able to significantly improve the quality of the shape estimation. Therefore, the model's elastic parameters are always initialized to the same value and they are subsequently modified depending on the data and the noise distribution.

{"id":"1436","title":"Modelling tomographic cone-beam projection data from a polyhedral phantom","abstract":"Analytical phantoms are used to generate projection data for testing reconstruction accuracy in computed axial tomography. A circular source locus (equivalent to rotating specimen with a fixed source) provides insufficient data for 'exact' reconstruction in cone-beam transmission tomography, thus phantom data are useful for studying the consequent errors and also for investigating alternative scanning loci and reconstruction techniques. We present an algorithm that can compute phantom cone-beam projection data from a phantom comprising geometrically defined polyhedra. Each polyhedron is defined as a set of polygons enclosing a volume of fixed linear attenuation coefficient. The algorithm works by projecting each polygon in turn onto the modelled detector array, which accumulates the product of source to polygon intersection distance (for the rays intersecting each detector element), linear attenuation coefficient and sign of projected polygon area (indicating whether rays enter or exit the polyhedron at this face).

In our institution, leaf verification for DMLC was initially done with film and ionization chamber. To overcome the limitations of these methods, a fast, accurate and two-dimensional method for daily leaf verification, using our CCD-camera based electronic portal imaging device (EPID), has been developed. This method is based on a flat field produced with a 0.5 cm wide sliding gap for each leaf pair. Deviations in gap widths are detected as deviations in gray scale value profiles derived from the EPID images, and not by directly assessing leaf positions in the images. Dedicated software was developed to reduce the noise level in the low signal images produced with the narrow gaps. The accuracy of this quality assurance procedure was tested by introducing known leaf position errors. It was shown that errors in leaf gap as small as 0.01-0.02 cm could be detected, which is certainly adequate to guarantee accurate dose delivery of DMLC treatments, even for strongly modulated beam profiles. Using this method, it was demonstrated that both short and long term reproducibility in leaf positioning were within 0.01 cm (1 sigma ) for all gantry angles, and that the effect of gravity was negligible","tok_text":"fast and accur leaf verif for dynam multileaf collim use an electron portal imag devic \n a prerequisit for accur dose deliveri of imrt profil produc with dynam multileaf collim ( dmlc ) is highli accur leaf posit . in our institut , leaf verif for dmlc wa initi done with film and ioniz chamber . to overcom the limit of these method , a fast , accur and two-dimension method for daili leaf verif , use our ccd-camera base electron portal imag devic ( epid ) , ha been develop . thi method is base on a flat field produc with a 0.5 cm wide slide gap for each leaf pair . deviat in gap width are detect as deviat in gray scale valu profil deriv from the epid imag , and not by directli assess leaf posit in the imag . dedic softwar wa develop to reduc the nois level in the low signal imag produc with the narrow gap . the accuraci of thi qualiti assur procedur wa test by introduc known leaf posit error . it wa shown that error in leaf gap as small as 0.01 - 0.02 cm could be detect , which is certainli adequ to guarante accur dose deliveri of dmlc treatment , even for strongli modul beam profil . use thi method , it wa demonstr that both short and long term reproduc in leaf posit were within 0.01 cm ( 1 sigma ) for all gantri angl , and that the effect of graviti wa neglig","ordered_present_kp":[9,30,60,107,281,355,407,540,559,581,615,755,777,887,1081,202,1226],"keyphrases":["accurate leaf verification","dynamic multileaf collimation","electronic portal imaging device","accurate dose delivery","leaf positioning","ionization chamber","two-dimensional method","CCD-camera based electronic portal imaging device","sliding gap","leaf pair","gap widths","gray scale value profiles","noise level","signal images","leaf position errors","modulated beam profiles","gantry angles","intensity modulated radiation therapy profiles","electronic portal imaging device images"],"prmu":["P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","M","R"]}

To deal with these questions, we review the literature on innovation in order to see how social capital came to be added to the other forms of capital as an explanatory variable of innovation. In doing so, we have been led to follow the dominating view of the literature on social capital and innovation which claims that social capital cannot be captured through a single indicator, but that it actually takes many different forms that must be accounted for. Therefore, to the traditional explanatory variables of innovation, we have added five forms of structural social capital (business network assets, information network assets, research network assets, participation assets, and relational assets) and one form of cognitive social capital (reciprocal trust).

HyCharts consist of two modular visual formalisms, one for the specification of the architecture and one for the specification of the behavior of hybrid systems. The operators on hierarchic graphs enable us to give a surprisingly simple denotational semantics for many concepts known from statechart-like formalisms.

Optimizing this likelihood with respect to the model parameters provides an unbiased and efficient estimator. The proposed numerical algorithms make this estimation computationally practical for a wide variety of circumstances. The results from this method compare favorably with state-of-the-art approaches that rely on the closest-point or perpendicular distance metric, a convenient heuristic that produces biased solutions and fails completely when surfaces are not sufficiently smooth, as in the case of complex scenes or noisy range measurements.

{"id":"1302","title":"Dynamics of the firing probability of noisy integrate-and-fire neurons","abstract":"Cortical neurons in vivo undergo a continuous bombardment due to synaptic activity, which acts as a major source of noise. We investigate the effects of the noise filtering by synapses with various levels of realism on integrate-and-fire neuron dynamics. The noise input is modeled by white (for instantaneous synapses) or colored (for synapses with a finite relaxation time) noise. Analytical results for the modulation of firing probability in response to an oscillatory input current are obtained by expanding a Fokker-Planck equation for small parameters of the problem-when both the amplitude of the modulation is small compared to the background firing rate and the synaptic time constant is small compared to the membrane time constant.

{"id":"757","title":"Ultrafast compound imaging for 2-D motion vector estimation: application to transient elastography","abstract":"This paper describes a new technique for two-dimensional (2-D) imaging of the motion vector at a very high frame rate with ultrasound. Its potential is experimentally demonstrated for transient elastography. But, beyond this application, it also could be promising for color flow and reflectivity imaging. To date, only axial displacements induced in human tissues by low-frequency vibrators were measured during transient elastography. The proposed technique allows us to follow both axial and lateral displacements during the shear wave propagation and thus should improve Young's modulus image reconstruction. The process is a combination of several ideas well-known in ultrasonic imaging: ultra-fast imaging, multisynthetic aperture beamforming, 1-D speckle tracking, and compound imaging. Classical beamforming in the transmit mode is replaced here by a single plane wave insonification increasing the frame rate by at least a factor of 128. The beamforming is achieved only in the receive mode on two independent subapertures. Comparison of successive frames by a classical 1-D speckle tracking algorithm allows estimation of displacements along two different directions linked to the subapertures beams. The variance of the estimates is finally improved by tilting the emitting plane wave at each insonification, thus allowing reception of successive decorrelated speckle patterns","tok_text":"ultrafast compound imag for 2-d motion vector estim : applic to transient elastographi \n thi paper describ a new techniqu for two-dimension ( 2-d ) imag of the motion vector at a veri high frame rate with ultrasound . it potenti is experiment demonstr for transient elastographi . but , beyond thi applic , it also could be promis for color flow and reflect imag . to date , onli axial displac induc in human tissu by low-frequ vibrat were measur dure transient elastographi . the propos techniqu allow us to follow both axial and later displac dure the shear wave propag and thu should improv young 's modulu imag reconstruct . the process is a combin of sever idea well-known in ultrason imag : ultra-fast imag , multisynthet apertur beamform , 1-d speckl track , and compound imag . classic beamform in the transmit mode is replac here by a singl plane wave insonif increas the frame rate by at least a factor of 128 . the beamform is achiev onli in the receiv mode on two independ subapertur . comparison of success frame by a classic 1-d speckl track algorithm allow estim of displac along two differ direct link to the subapertur beam . the varianc of the estim is final improv by tilt the emit plane wave at each insonif , thu allow recept of success decorrel speckl pattern","ordered_present_kp":[0,64,184,205,350,403,380,531,554,594,681,715,1258,844],"keyphrases":["ultrafast compound imaging","transient elastography","high frame rate","ultrasound","reflectivity imaging","axial displacements","human tissues","lateral displacements","shear wave propagation","Young's modulus image reconstruction","ultrasonic imaging","multisynthetic aperture beamforming","single plane wave insonification","decorrelated speckle patterns","2D motion vector estimation","two-dimensional imaging","2D imaging","colour flow imaging","1D speckle tracking algorithm"],"prmu":["P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","M","R","M","M","M"]}

Its main accomplishment is to extend the range of applicability of the adaptive wavelet-based method developed previously for symmetric positive definite problems to indefinite or unsymmetric systems of operator equations. This is accomplished by first introducing techniques (such as the least squares formulation developed previously) that transform the original (continuous) problem into an equivalent infinite system of equations which is now well-posed in the Euclidean metric. It is then shown how to utilize adaptive techniques to solve the resulting infinite system of equations. It is shown that for a wide range of problems, this new adaptive method performs with asymptotically optimal complexity, i.e., it recovers an approximate solution with desired accuracy at a computational expense that stays proportional to the number of terms in a corresponding wavelet-best N-term approximation.

However, data caching strategies for LDISs have thus far received little attention. In this paper, we study the issues of cache invalidation and cache replacement for location-dependent data under a geometric location model. We introduce a new performance criterion, called caching efficiency, and propose a generic method for location-dependent cache invalidation strategies. In addition, two cache replacement policies, PA and PAID, are proposed. Unlike the conventional replacement policies, PA and PAID take into consideration the valid scope area of a data value. We conduct a series of simulation experiments to study the performance of the proposed caching schemes.

LOT concerns the semantically relevant structure of representations involved in cognitive states such as beliefs and desires. It maintains that all such representations must have syntactic structures mirroring the structure of their contents. IBS is a thesis about the nature of the relations that connect cognitive representations and their parts to their contents (semantic relations). It holds that these relations supervene solely on relations of the kind that support information content, perhaps with some help from logical principles of combination.

The first scheme uses artificial neural networks as transfer functions between the CIELAB and CMYK spaces. The second scheme is based on a reformulation of tetrahedral interpolation as an optimization problem. Characterization data are divided into tetrahedra for the interpolation-based approach using the program Qhull, which removes the common restriction that characterization data be well organized. Both schemes offer user control over trade-off problems such as cost versus reproduction accuracy, allowing for user-specified print objectives and the use of constraints such as maximum allowable ink and maximum allowable AE*\/sub ab\/.

The combination of the features has been performed using a weighted summation. Results indicate a 10% improvement in specificity at a sensitivity of 96% after combining the information at the site and at the boundary.

An advantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that it allows each application to locally derive next-hop routing information without requiring a routing protocol in the overlay. A disadvantage of using a Delaunay triangulation is that the mapping of the overlay to the network topology at the network and data link layer may be suboptimal. We present a protocol, called Delaunay triangulation (DT protocol), which constructs Delaunay triangulation overlay networks.

The HPF Library consists of 55 generic functions. The implementation of this library presents the challenge that all data types, data kinds, array ranks and input distributions need to be supported. For instance, more than 2 billion separate functions are required to support COPY-SCATTER fully. The efficient support of these billions of specific functions is one of the outstanding problems of HPF. We have solved this problem by developing a library generator which utilizes the mechanism of parameterized templates. This mechanism allows the procedures to be instantiated at compile time for arguments with a specific type, kind, rank and distribution over a specific processor array. We describe the algorithms used in the different library functions. The implementation gives the ease of generating a large number of library routines from a single template.

{"id":"1365","title":"Deadlock-free scheduling in flexible manufacturing systems using Petri nets","abstract":"This paper addresses the deadlock-free scheduling problem in Flexible Manufacturing Systems. An efficient deadlock-free scheduling algorithm was developed, using timed Petri nets, for a class of FMSs called Systems of Sequential Systems with Shared Resources (S\/sup 4\/ R). The algorithm generates a partial reachability graph to find the optimal or near-optimal deadlock-free schedule in terms of the firing sequence of the transitions of the Petri net model. The objective is to minimize the mean flow time (MFT). An efficient truncation technique, based on the siphon concept, has been developed and used to generate the minimum necessary portion of the reachability graph to be searched. It has been shown experimentally that the developed siphon truncation technique enhances the ability to develop deadlock-free schedules of systems with a high number of deadlocks, which cannot be achieved using standard Petri net scheduling approaches. It may be necessary, in some cases, to relax the optimality condition for large FMSs in order to make the search effort reasonable. Hence, a User Control Factor (UCF) was defined and used in the scheduling algorithm. The objective of using the UCF is to achieve an acceptable trade-off between the solution quality and the search effort. Its effect on the MFT and the CPU time has been investigated. Randomly generated examples are used for illustration and comparison.

At the same time, the emergence of an increasingly large number of application areas and the evolution of the networking technology suggest that in the near future the Internet may become the single integrated communication infrastructure. However, as the dependence on the networking infrastructure grows, its security becomes a major concern, in light of the increased attempt to compromise the infrastructure. In particular, the routing operation is a highly visible target that must be shielded against a wide range of attacks. The injection of false routing information can easily degrade network performance, or even cause denial of service for a large number of hosts and networks over a long period of time. Different approaches have been proposed to secure the routing protocols, with a variety of countermeasures, which, nonetheless, have not eradicated the vulnerability of the routing infrastructure.

{"id":"1285","title":"On fractal dimension in information systems. Toward exact sets in infinite information systems","abstract":"The notions of an exact as well as a rough set are well-grounded as basic notions in rough set theory. They are however defined in the setting of a finite information system i.e. an information system having finite numbers of objects as well as attributes. In theoretical studies e.g. of topological properties of rough sets, one has to trespass this limitation and to consider information systems with potentially unbound number of attributes.

In case that no data are available for the calculation of the attenuation correction factors one can try to determine them from the emission data alone. However, it is not clear if the information content is sufficient to yield an adequate attenuation correction together with a satisfactory activity distribution. Therefore, we determined the log likelihood distribution for a thorax phantom depending on the choice of attenuation and activity pixel values to measure the crosstalk between both. In addition an iterative image reconstruction (one-dimensional Newton-type algorithm with a maximum likelihood estimator), which simultaneously reconstructs the images of the activity distribution and the attenuation coefficients is used to demonstrate the problems and possibilities of such a reconstruction. As result we show that for a change of the log likelihood in the range of statistical noise, the associated change in the activity value of a structure is between 6% and 263%. In addition, we show that it is not possible to choose the best maximum on the basis of the log likelihood when a regularization is used, because the coupling between different structures mediated by the (smoothing) regularization prevents an adequate solution due to crosstalk.

{"id":"1224","title":"Formalization of weighted factors analysis","abstract":"Weighted factors analysis (WeFA) has been proposed as a new approach for elicitation, representation, and manipulation of knowledge about a given problem, generally at a high and strategic level. Central to this proposal is that a group of experts in the area of the problem can identify a hierarchy of factors with positive or negative influences on the problem outcome. The tangible output of WeFA is a directed weighted graph called a WeFA graph. This is a set of nodes denoting factors that can directly or indirectly influence an overall aim of the graph. The aim is also represented by a node. Each directed arc is a direct influence of one factor on another. A chain of directed arcs indicates an indirect influence. The influences may be identified as either positive or negative. For example, sales and costs are two factors that influence the aim of profitability in an organization. Sales has a positive influence on profitability and costs has a negative influence on profitability. In addition, the relative significance of each influence is represented by a weight. We develop Binary WeFA which is a variant of WeFA where the factors in the graph are restricted to being either true or false. Imposing this restriction on a WeFA graph allows us to be more precise about the meaning of the graph and of reasoning in it. Binary WeFA is a new proposal that provides a formal yet sufficiently simple language for logic-based argumentation for use by business people in decision-support and knowledge management.

The ASDT algorithm adopts a different point representation scheme that uses only the lower comer vertex to represent a (hyper-)rectangle, with the upper comer vertex serving as the augmented information. Consequently, the ASDT algorithm can keep the working space the same as the original n-dimensional space and, in general, a much better balanced tree can be expected. This, together with the introduction of an additional bounding subregion for the rectangles associated with each tree node, makes it possible to significantly reduce the number of node visits in the region search, although each node visit may be slightly more expensive. Three examples arising in computational mechanics are presented to provide an assessment of the performance of the ASDT.

{"id":"1306","title":"Scalable hybrid computation with spikes","abstract":"We outline a hybrid analog-digital scheme for computing with three important features that enable it to scale to systems of large complexity: First, like digital computation, which uses several one-bit precise logical units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation, the hybrid scheme uses several moderate-precision analog units to collectively compute a precise answer to a computation. Second, frequent discrete signal restoration of the analog information prevents analog noise and offset from degrading the computation. Third, a state machine enables complex computations to be created using a sequence of elementary computations. A natural choice for implementing this hybrid scheme is one based on spikes because spike-count codes are digital, while spike-time codes are analog. We illustrate how spikes afford easy ways to implement all three components of scalable hybrid computation. First, as an important example of distributed analog computation, we show how spikes can create a distributed modular representation of an analog number by implementing digital carry interactions between spiking analog neurons. Second, we show how signal restoration may be performed by recursive spike-count quantization of spike-time codes. Third, we use spikes from an analog dynamical system to trigger state transitions in a digital dynamical system, which reconfigures the analog dynamical system using a binary control vector; such feedback interactions between analog and digital dynamical systems create a hybrid state machine (HSM). The HSM extends and expands the concept of a digital finite-state-machine to the hybrid domain. We present experimental data from a two-neuron HSM on a chip that implements error-correcting analog-to-digital conversion with the concurrent use of spike-time and spike-count codes. We also present experimental data from silicon circuits that implement HSM-based pattern recognition using spike-time synchrony.

After the commissioning of a high-rise building or a large estate, substantial manpower, both inside the management centre under a standby manner, as well as surveillance for security purposes around the whole building, is required for daily operation to ensure a quality environment for the occupants. If the surveillance job can be done by robots, the efficiency can be highly enhanced, resulting in a great saving of manpower and the improved safety of the management staff as a by-product. Furthermore, if the robot can retrieve commands from the building management system via a local area network (LAN), further savings in manpower can be achieved in terms of first-line fault attendance by human management staff. This paper describes the development of a robot prototype here in Hong Kong, which can handle some daily routine maintenance works and surveillance responsibilities. The hardware structure of the robot and its on-board devices are described. Real-time images captured by a camera on the robot with pan\/tilt\/zoom functions can be transmitted back to the central management office via a local area network.

The reduction is from many integrate-and-fire neurons to a spatially coarse-grained system for firing rates of neuronal subpopulations. It accounts explicitly for spatially varying architecture, ordered cortical maps (such as orientation preference) that vary regularly across the cortical layer, and disordered cortical maps (such as spatial phase preference or stochastic input conductances) that may vary widely from cortical neuron to cortical neuron. The result of the reduction is a set of nonlinear spatiotemporal integral equations for \"phase-averaged\" firing rates of neuronal subpopulations across the model cortex, derived asymptotically from the full model without the addition of any extra phenomological constants.

{"id":"697","title":"Schedulability analysis of real-time traffic in WorldFIP networks: an integrated approach","abstract":"The WorldFIP protocol is one of the profiles that constitute the European fieldbus standard EN-50170. It is particularly well suited to be used in distributed computer-controlled systems where a set of process variables must be shared among network devices. To cope with the real-time requirements of such systems, the protocol provides communication services based on the exchange of periodic and aperiodic identified variables. The periodic exchanges have the highest priority and are executed at run time according to a cyclic schedule. Therefore, the respective schedulability can be determined at pre-run-time when building the schedule table. Concerning the aperiodic exchanges, the situation is different since their priority is lower and they are bandied according to a first-come-first-served policy. In this paper, a response-time-based schedulability analysis for the real-time traffic is presented. Such analysis considers both types of traffic in an integrated way, according to their priorities. Furthermore, a fixed-priorities-based policy is also used to schedule the periodic traffic. The proposed analysis represents an improvement relative to previous work and it can be evaluated online as part of a traffic online admission control.

{"id":"1301","title":"Integrate-and-fire neurons driven by correlated stochastic input","abstract":"Neurons are sensitive to correlations among synaptic inputs. However, analytical models that explicitly include correlations are hard to solve analytically, so their influence on a neuron's response has been difficult to ascertain. To gain some intuition on this problem, we studied the firing times of two simple integrate-and-fire model neurons driven by a correlated binary variable that represents the total input current. Analytic expressions were obtained for the average firing rate and coefficient of variation (a measure of spike-train variability) as functions of the mean, variance, and correlation time of the stochastic input. The results of computer simulations were in excellent agreement with these expressions. In these models, an increase in correlation time in general produces an increase in both the average firing rate and the variability of the output spike trains. However, the magnitude of the changes depends differentially on the relative values of the input mean and variance: the increase in firing rate is higher when the variance is large relative to the mean, whereas the increase in variability is higher when the variance is relatively small. In addition, the firing rate always tends to a finite limit value as the correlation time increases toward infinity, whereas the coefficient of variation typically diverges. These results suggest that temporal correlations may play a major role in determining the variability as well as the intensity of neuronal spike trains","tok_text":"integrate-and-fir neuron driven by correl stochast input \n neuron are sensit to correl among synapt input . howev , analyt model that explicitli includ correl are hard to solv analyt , so their influenc on a neuron 's respons ha been difficult to ascertain . to gain some intuit on thi problem , we studi the fire time of two simpl integrate-and-fir model neuron driven by a correl binari variabl that repres the total input current . analyt express were obtain for the averag fire rate and coeffici of variat ( a measur of spike-train variabl ) as function of the mean , varianc , and correl time of the stochast input . the result of comput simul were in excel agreement with these express . in these model , an increas in correl time in gener produc an increas in both the averag fire rate and the variabl of the output spike train . howev , the magnitud of the chang depend differenti on the rel valu of the input mean and varianc : the increas in fire rate is higher when the varianc is larg rel to the mean , wherea the increas in variabl is higher when the varianc is rel small . in addit , the fire rate alway tend to a finit limit valu as the correl time increas toward infin , wherea the coeffici of variat typic diverg . these result suggest that tempor correl may play a major role in determin the variabl as well as the intens of neuron spike train","ordered_present_kp":[0,35,309,375,491,524,636,816,1258],"keyphrases":["integrate-and-fire neurons","correlated stochastic input","firing times","correlated binary variable","coefficient of variation","spike-train variability","computer simulation","output spike trains","temporal correlations","synaptic input correlations"],"prmu":["P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","R"]}

{"id":"769","title":"Permission grids: practical, error-bounded simplification","abstract":"We introduce the permission grid, a spatial occupancy grid which can be used to guide almost any standard polygonal surface simplification algorithm into generating an approximation with a guaranteed geometric error bound. In particular, all points on the approximation are guaranteed to be within some user-specified distance from the original surface. Such bounds are notably absent from many current simplification methods, and are becoming increasingly important for applications in scientific computing and adaptive level of detail control. Conceptually simple, the permission grid defines a volume in which the approximation must lie, and does not permit the underlying simplification algorithm to generate approximations outside the volume. The permission grid makes three important, practical improvements over current error-bounded simplification methods. First, it works on arbitrary triangular models, handling all manners of mesh degeneracies gracefully. Further, the error tolerance may be easily expanded as simplification proceeds, allowing the construction of an error-bounded level of detail hierarchy with vertex correspondences among all levels of detail. And finally, the permission grid has a representation complexity independent of the size of the input model, and a small running time overhead, making it more practical and efficient than current methods with similar guarantees","tok_text":"permiss grid : practic , error-bound simplif \n we introduc the permiss grid , a spatial occup grid which can be use to guid almost ani standard polygon surfac simplif algorithm into gener an approxim with a guarante geometr error bound . in particular , all point on the approxim are guarante to be within some user-specifi distanc from the origin surfac . such bound are notabl absent from mani current simplif method , and are becom increasingli import for applic in scientif comput and adapt level of detail control . conceptu simpl , the permiss grid defin a volum in which the approxim must lie , and doe not permit the underli simplif algorithm to gener approxim outsid the volum . the permiss grid make three import , practic improv over current error-bound simplif method . first , it work on arbitrari triangular model , handl all manner of mesh degeneraci grace . further , the error toler may be easili expand as simplif proce , allow the construct of an error-bound level of detail hierarchi with vertex correspond among all level of detail . and final , the permiss grid ha a represent complex independ of the size of the input model , and a small run time overhead , make it more practic and effici than current method with similar guarante","ordered_present_kp":[0,80,144,207,191,25,311,469,489,801,850,888,1009,1089,1161],"keyphrases":["permission grid","error-bounded simplification","spatial occupancy grid","polygonal surface simplification algorithm","approximation","guaranteed geometric error bound","user-specified distance","scientific computing","adaptive level of detail control","arbitrary triangular models","mesh degeneracies","error tolerance","vertex correspondences","representation complexity","running time overhead"],"prmu":["P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P"]}

{"id":"1141","title":"Reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position","abstract":"Purpose: In breast conserving therapy, complete excision of the tumor with an acceptable cosmetic outcome depends on accurate localization in terms of both the position of the lesion and its extent. We hypothesize that preoperative contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the patient in a supine position may be used for accurate tumor localization and marking of its extent immediately prior to surgery. Our aims in this study are to assess the reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position, to evaluate the effect of a breast immobilization device, and to derive reproducibility margins that take internal tissue shifts into account occurring between repeat setups. Materials Methods: The reproducibility of mammary gland structure during repeat setups in a supine position is estimated by quantification of tissue shifts in the breasts of healthy volunteers between repeat MR setups. For each volunteer fiducials are identified and registered with their counter locations in corresponding MR volumes. The difference in position denotes the shift of breast tissue. The dependence on breast volume and the part of the breast, as well as the effect of a breast immobilization cast are studied. Results: The tissue shifts are small with a mean standard deviation on the order of 1.5 mm, being slightly larger in large breasts (V>1000 cm\/sup 3\/), and in the posterior part (toward the pectoral muscle) of both small and large breasts. The application of a breast immobilization cast reduces the tissue shifts in large breasts.

{"id":"57","title":"Speaker adaptive modeling by vocal tract normalization","abstract":"This paper presents methods for speaker adaptive modeling using vocal tract normalization (VTN) along with experimental tests on three databases. We propose a new training method for VTN: By using single-density acoustic models per HMM state for selecting the scale factor of the frequency axis, we avoid the problem that a mixture-density tends to learn the scale factors of the training speakers and thus cannot be used for selecting the scale factor. We show that using single Gaussian densities for selecting the scale factor in training results in lower error rates than using mixture densities. For the recognition phase, we propose an improvement of the well-known two-pass strategy: by using a non-normalized acoustic model for the first recognition pass instead of a normalized model, lower error rates are obtained. In recognition tests, this method is compared with a fast variant of VTN. The two-pass strategy is an efficient method, but it is suboptimal because the scale factor and the word sequence are determined sequentially. We found that for telephone digit string recognition this suboptimality reduces the VTN gain in recognition performance by 30% relative.

Droplet ejection sequences of two microinjectors have been studied along with a commercial inkjet printhead for comparison. The droplet ejection of our microinjector with 10 mu m diameter nozzle has been characterized at a frequency over 35 kHz, at least 3 times higher than those of commercial counterparts. The droplet volume from this device is smaller than 1 pl, 10 times smaller than those of commercial inkjets employed in the consumer market at the time of testing.

To reduce this high number of biopsies performed on benign lesions, a case-based reasoning (CBR) classifier was developed to predict biopsy results from BI-RADS\/sup TM\/ findings. We used 1433 (931 benign) biopsy-proven mammographic cases. CBR similarity was defined using either the Hamming or Euclidean distance measure over case features. Ten features represented each case: calcification distribution, calcification morphology, calcification number, mass margin, mass shape, mass density, mass size, associated findings, special cases, and age. Performance was evaluated using Round Robin sampling, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, and bootstrap. To determine the most influential features for the CBR, an exhaustive feature search was performed over all possible feature combinations (1022) and similarity thresholds. Influential features were defined as the most frequently occurring features in the feature subsets with the highest partial ROC areas (\/sub 0.90\/AUC). For CBR with Hamming distance, the most influential features were found to be mass margin, calcification morphology, age, calcification distribution, calcification number, and mass shape, resulting in an \/sub 0.90\/AUC of 0.33. At 95% sensitivity, the Hamming CBR would spare from biopsy 34% of the benign lesions. At 98% sensitivity, the Hamming CBR would spare 27% benign lesions. For the CBR with Euclidean distance, the most influential feature subset consisted of mass margin, calcification morphology, age, mass density, and associated findings, resulting in \/sub 0.90\/AUC of 0.37. At 95% sensitivity, the Euclidean CBR would spare from biopsy 41% benign lesions. At 98% sensitivity, the Euclidean CBR would spare 27% benign lesions. The profile of cases spared by both distance measures at 98% sensitivity indicates that the CBR is a potentially useful diagnostic tool for the classification of mammographic lesions, by recommending short-term follow-up for likely benign lesions that is in agreement with final biopsy results and mammographer's intuition","tok_text":"develop and evalu of a case-bas reason classifi for predict of breast biopsi outcom with bi-rad \/ sup tm\/ lexicon \n approxim 70 - 85 % of breast biopsi are perform on benign lesion . to reduc thi high number of biopsi perform on benign lesion , a case-bas reason ( cbr ) classifi wa develop to predict biopsi result from bi-rad \/ sup tm\/ find . we use 1433 ( 931 benign ) biopsy-proven mammograph case . cbr similar wa defin use either the ham or euclidean distanc measur over case featur . ten featur repres each case : calcif distribut , calcif morpholog , calcif number , mass margin , mass shape , mass densiti , mass size , associ find , special case , and age . perform wa evalu use round robin sampl , receiv oper characterist ( roc ) analysi , and bootstrap . to determin the most influenti featur for the cbr , an exhaust featur search wa perform over all possibl featur combin ( 1022 ) and similar threshold . influenti featur were defin as the most frequent occur featur in the featur subset with the highest partial roc area ( \/sub 0.90 \/ auc ) . for cbr with ham distanc , the most influenti featur were found to be mass margin , calcif morpholog , age , calcif distribut , calcif number , and mass shape , result in an \/sub 0.90 \/ auc of 0.33 . at 95 % sensit , the ham cbr would spare from biopsi 34 % of the benign lesion . at 98 % sensit , the ham cbr would spare 27 % benign lesion . for the cbr with euclidean distanc , the most influenti featur subset consist of mass margin , calcif morpholog , age , mass densiti , and associ find , result in \/sub 0.90 \/ auc of 0.37 . at 95 % sensit , the euclidean cbr would spare from biopsi 41 % benign lesion . at 98 % sensit , the euclidean cbr would spare 27 % benign lesion . the profil of case spare by both distanc measur at 98 % sensit indic that the cbr is a potenti use diagnost tool for the classif of mammograph lesion , by recommend short-term follow-up for like benign lesion that is in agreement with final biopsi result and mammograph 's intuit","ordered_present_kp":[23,63,167,372,404,447,521,540,559,575,589,602,617,629,643,662,689,756,873,900,989,1012,789,1838,1904],"keyphrases":["case-based reasoning classifier","breast biopsy outcome","benign lesions","biopsy-proven mammographic cases","CBR similarity","Euclidean distance measure","calcification distribution","calcification morphology","calcification number","mass margin","mass shape","mass density","mass size","associated findings","special cases","age","Round Robin sampling","bootstrap","influential features","feature combinations","similarity thresholds","feature subsets","highest partial ROC areas","diagnostic tool","short-term follow-up","BI-RADS lexicon","Hamming distance measure","Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis","mammographic lesion classification"],"prmu":["P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","R","R","R","R"]}

{"id":"1362","title":"Process planning for reliable high-speed machining of moulds","abstract":"A method of generating NC programs for the high-speed milling of moulds is investigated. Forging dies and injection moulds, whether plastic or aluminium, have a complex surface geometry. In addition they are made of steels of hardness as much as 30 or even 50 HRC. Since 1995, high-speed machining has been much adopted by the die-making industry, which with this technology can reduce its use of Sinking Electrodischarge Machining (SEDM). EDM, in general, calls for longer machining times. The use of high-speed machining makes it necessary to redefine the preliminary stages of the process. In addition, it affects the methodology employed in the generation of NC programs, which requires the use of high-level CAM software. The aim is to generate error-free programs that make use of optimum cutting strategies in the interest of productivity and surface quality. The final result is a more reliable manufacturing process. There are two risks in the use of high-speed milling on hardened steels. One of these is tool breakage, which may be very costly and may furthermore entail marks on the workpiece. The other is collisions between the tool and the workpiece or fixtures, the result of which may be damage to the ceramic bearings in the spindles. in order to minimize these risks it is necessary that new control and optimization steps be included in the CAM methodology. There are three things that the firm adopting high-speed methods should do. It should redefine its process engineering, it should systematize access by its CAM programmers to high-speed knowhow, and it should take up the use of process simulation tools. In the latter case, it will be very advantageous to use tools for the estimation of cutting forces.

The procedural solid texture is then mapped back onto the object surface using standard texture mapping. The implementation renders procedural solid textures in real time, and the user can design them interactively. The quality of this technique depends greatly on the layout of the texture atlas.

{"id":"1063","title":"Operations that do not disturb partially known quantum states","abstract":"Consider a situation in which a quantum system is secretly prepared in a state chosen from the known set of states. We present a principle that gives a definite distinction between the operations that preserve the states of the system and those that disturb the states. The principle is derived by alternately applying a fundamental property of classical signals and a fundamental property of quantum ones. The principle can be cast into a simple form by using a decomposition of the relevant Hilbert space, which is uniquely determined by the set of possible states. The decomposition implies the classification of the degrees of freedom of the system into three parts depending on how they store the information on the initially chosen state: one storing it classically, one storing it nonclassically, and the other one storing no information. Then the principle states that the nonclassical part is inaccessible and the classical part is read-only if we are to preserve the state of the system. From this principle, many types of no-cloning, no-broadcasting, and no-imprinting conditions can easily be derived in general forms including mixed states. It also gives a unified view on how various schemes of quantum cryptography work.

{"id":"652","title":"A case for end system multicast","abstract":"The conventional wisdom has been that Internet protocol (IP) is the natural protocol layer for implementing multicast related functionality. However, more than a decade after its initial proposal, IP multicast is still plagued with concerns pertaining to scalability, network management, deployment, and support for higher layer functionality such as error, flow, and congestion control. We explore an alternative architecture that we term end system multicast, where end systems implement all multicast related functionality including membership management and packet replication. This shifting of multicast support from routers to end systems has the potential to address most problems associated with IP multicast. However, the key concern is the performance penalty associated with such a model. In particular, end system multicast introduces duplicate packets on physical links and incurs larger end-to-end delays than IP multicast. We study these performance concerns in the context of the Narada protocol. In Narada, end systems self-organize into an overlay structure using a fully distributed protocol. Further, end systems attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to network dynamics and by considering application level performance. We present details of Narada and evaluate it using both simulation and Internet experiments. Our results indicate that the performance penalties are low both from the application and the network perspectives.

Scientific applications that stream multimedia include remote computational steering of visualization data and video-on-demand teleconferencing over the Access Grid. However, UDP does not possess a self-regulating, congestion-control mechanism; and most best-effort traffic is served by congestion-controlled TCP. Consequently, UDP steals bandwidth from TCP such that TCP flows starve for network resources. With the volume of Internet traffic continuing to increase, the perpetuation of UDP-based streaming will cause the Internet to collapse as it did in the mid-1980's due to the use of non-congestion-controlled TCP. To address this problem, we introduce the counter-intuitive notion of inter-packet spacing with control feedback to enable UDP-based applications to perform well in the next-generation Internet and computational grids.

When a relaxation oscillator is coupled to an external periodic force its entrainment by the force results in a response which can include multiple periodicities and bistability. The prototype of these behaviors is the harmonically driven van der Pol equation which displays regions in the parameter space of the driving force amplitude where stable orbits of periods 2n+or-1 coexist, flanked by regions of periods 2n+1 and 2n-1. The parameter regions of such bistable orbits are derived analytically for the closely related harmonically driven Stoker-Haag piecewise discontinuous equation. The results are valid over most of the control parameter space of the system. Also considered are the reasons for the more complicated dynamics featuring regions of high multiple periodicity which appear like noise between ordered periodic regions.

In this work, we report an S\/sub c\/ calculation algorithm for symmetric, asymmetric, and irregular open fields shaped by the tertiary collimator (a multileaf collimator or blocks) at different source-to-chamber distance. The algorithm was based on a three-source model, in which the photon radiation to the point of calculation was treated as if it originated from three effective sources: one source for the primary photons from the target and two extra-focal photon sources for the scattered photons from the primary collimator and the flattening filter, respectively. The field mapping method proposed by Kim et al. [Phys. Med. Biol. 43, 1593-1604 (1998)] was extended to two extra-focal source planes and the scatter contributions were integrated over the projected areas (determined by the detector's eye view) in the three source planes considering the source intensity distributions. The algorithm was implemented using Microsoft Visual C\/C++ in the MS Windows environment. The only input data required were head scatter factors for symmetric square fields, which are normally acquired during machine commissioning. A large number of different fields were used to evaluate the algorithm and the results were compared with measurements.

Next we show that payoff functions with multiple cross-holdings can be solved by the contraction principle. The payoff functions which we derive provide a number of insights about the risk structure of company cross-holdings. First, the Modigliani-Miller theorem can obtain when there exist cross-holdings between firms. Second, by establishing cross-shareholdings each of stock holders distributes a part of its payoff values to the bond holder of the other's firm, so that both firms can decrease credit risks by cross-shareholdings. In the numerical examples, we show that the correlation in firms can be a critical condition for reducing credit risk by cross-holdings of stock using Monte Carlo simulation.

First, we analyze the limitation of conventional patching when the customer request rate is high. Then, by combining the advantages of each of the two broadcast schemes, we propose a hybrid broadcast scheme for popular videos, which not only lowers the service latency but also improves clients' interactivity by using an active buffering technique.

We hope to show three things. First, that the notion of selective representing is fully consistent with the realist idea of a mind-independent world. Second, that not only are these two consistent, but that the latter (the realist conception of a mind-independent world) provides the most powerful perspective from which to motivate and understand the differing perceptual and cognitive profiles themselves.

{"id":"925","title":"A fundamental investigation into large strain recovery of one-way shape memory alloy wires embedded in flexible polyurethanes","abstract":"Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are being embedded in or externally attached to smart structures because of the large amount of actuation deformation and force that these materials are capable of producing when they are heated. Previous investigations have focused primarily on using single or opposing SMA wires exhibiting the two-way shape memory effect (SME) because of the simplicity with which the repeatable actuation behavior of the structure can be predicted. This repeatable actuation behavior is achieved at the expense of reduced levels of recoverable deformation. Alternatively, many potential smart structure applications will employ multiple SMA wires exhibiting a permanent one-way SME to simplify fabrication and increase the recoverable strains in the structure. To employ the one-way wires, it is necessary to investigate how they affect the recovery of large strains when they are embedded in a structure. In this investigation, the large strain recovery of a one-way SMA wire embedded in a flexible polyurethane is characterized using the novel deformation measurement technique known as digital image correlation. These results are compared with a simple actuation model and a three-dimensional finite element analysis of the structure using the Brinson model for describing the thermomechanical behavior of the SMA. Results indicate that the level of actuation strain in the structure is substantially reduced by the inelastic behavior of the one-way SMA wires, and there are significant differences between the deformations of the matrix material adjacent to the SMA wires and in the region surrounding it.

The cycling can be prevented by maintaining strongly feasible bases proposed by Cunningham (1976); however, if we do not impose any restrictions on the entering variables, the algorithm can still perform an exponentially long sequence of degenerate pivots. This phenomenon is known as stalling. Researchers have suggested several pivot rules with the following bounds on the number of consecutive degenerate pivots: m, n\/sup 2\/, k(k + 1)\/2, where n is the number of nodes in the network, m is the number of arcs in the network, and k is the number of degenerate arcs in the basis.

The statistics of the distribution of these weights is cast into an effect-volume histogram (EVH) in analogy to dose-volume histograms. The analysis of the EVH reveals which traits of the optimum dose distribution result from the defined objectives, and which are a random consequence of under- or misspecification of treatment goals.

{"id":"1147","title":"Angular disparity in ETACT scintimammography","abstract":"Emission tuned aperture computed tomography (ETACT) has been previously shown to have the potential for the detection of small tumors (<1 cm) in scintimammography. However, the optimal approach to the application of ETACT in the clinic has yet to be determined. Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of the angular disparity between the ETACT projections on image quality through the use of a computer simulation. A small, spherical tumor of variable size (5, 7.5 or 10 mm) was placed at the center of a hemispherical breast (15 cm diameter). The tumor to nontumor ratio was either 5:1 or 10:1. The detector was modeled to be a gamma camera fitted with a 4-mm-diam pinhole collimator. The pinhole-to-detector and the pinhole-to-tumor distances were 25 and 15 cm, respectively. A ray tracing technique was used to generate three sets of projections (10 degrees , 15 degrees , and 20 degrees , angular disparity). These data were blurred to a resolution consistent with the 4 mm pinhole. The TACT reconstruction method was used to reconstruct these three image sets. The tumor contrast and the axial spatial resolution was measured. Smaller angular disparity led to an improvement in image contrast but at a cost of degraded axial spatial resolution. The improvement in contrast is due to a slight improvement in the in-plane spatial resolution. Since improved contrast should lead to better tumor detectability, smaller angular disparity should be used. However, the difference in contrast between 10 degrees and 15 degrees was very slight and therefore a reasonable clinical choice for angular disparity is 15 degrees","tok_text":"angular dispar in etact scintimammographi \n emiss tune apertur comput tomographi ( etact ) ha been previous shown to have the potenti for the detect of small tumor ( < 1 cm ) in scintimammographi . howev , the optim approach to the applic of etact in the clinic ha yet to be determin . therefor , we sought to determin the effect of the angular dispar between the etact project on imag qualiti through the use of a comput simul . a small , spheric tumor of variabl size ( 5 , 7.5 or 10 mm ) wa place at the center of a hemispher breast ( 15 cm diamet ) . the tumor to nontumor ratio wa either 5:1 or 10:1 . the detector wa model to be a gamma camera fit with a 4-mm-diam pinhol collim . the pinhole-to-detector and the pinhole-to-tumor distanc were 25 and 15 cm , respect . a ray trace techniqu wa use to gener three set of project ( 10 degre , 15 degre , and 20 degre , angular dispar ) . these data were blur to a resolut consist with the 4 mm pinhol . the tact reconstruct method wa use to reconstruct these three imag set . the tumor contrast and the axial spatial resolut wa measur . smaller angular dispar led to an improv in imag contrast but at a cost of degrad axial spatial resolut . the improv in contrast is due to a slight improv in the in-plan spatial resolut . sinc improv contrast should lead to better tumor detect , smaller angular dispar should be use . howev , the differ in contrast between 10 degre and 15 degre wa veri slight and therefor a reason clinic choic for angular dispar is 15 degre","ordered_present_kp":[0,152,381,415,440,519,637,671,719,776,1017,1055,1250,1471],"keyphrases":["angular disparity","small tumors","image quality","computer simulation","spherical tumor","hemispherical breast","gamma camera","pinhole collimator","pinhole-to-tumor distances","ray tracing technique","image sets","axial spatial resolution","in-plane spatial resolution","clinical choice","emission tuned aperture computed tomography scintimammography","pinhole-to-detector distances","tuned aperture computed tomography reconstruction method"],"prmu":["P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","P","R","R","R"]}

Above all, it defines the standard HL7 message formats prescribed by the standard encoding rules. In this paper, we propose a flexible, reusable, and extensible HL7 encoding and decoding framework using a message object model (MOM) and message definition repository (MDR). The MOM provides an abstract HL7 message form represented by a group of objects and their relationships. It reflects logical relationships among the standard HL7 message elements such as segments, fields, and components, while enforcing the key structural constraints imposed by the standard. Since the MOM completely eliminates the dependency of the HL7 encoder and decoder on platform-specific data formats, it makes it possible to build the encoder and decoder as reusable standalone software components, enabling the interconnection of arbitrary heterogeneous hospital information systems (HIS) with little effort. Moreover, the MDR, an external database of key definitions for HL7 messages, helps make the encoder and decoder as resilient as possible to future modifications of the standard HL7 message formats. It is also used by the encoder and decoder to perform a well-formedness check for their respective inputs (i.e., HL7 message objects expressed in the MOM and encoded HL7 message strings).

Unfortunately, LM depends sensitively on the initial guess, necessitating repeated runs. This, combined with LM's high per-step cost, makes its computational burden quite high. To reduce this burden, we trained a multilayer perceptron (MLP) as a realtime localizer. We used an analytical model of quasistatic electromagnetic propagation through a spherical head to map randomly chosen dipoles to sensor activities according to the sensor geometry of a 4D Neuroimaging Neuromag-122 MEG system, and trained a MLP to invert this mapping in the absence of noise or in the presence of various sorts of noise such as white Gaussian noise, correlated noise, or real brain noise. A MLP structure was chosen to trade off computation and accuracy. This MLP was trained four times, with each type of noise. We measured the effects of initial guesses on LM performance, which motivated a hybrid MLP-start-LM method, in which the trained MLP initializes LM. We also compared the localization performance of LM, MLPs, and hybrid MLP-start-LMs for realistic brain signals. Trained MLPs are much faster than other methods, while the hybrid MLP-start-LMs are faster and more accurate than fixed-4-start-LM. In particular, the hybrid MLP-start-LM initialized by a MLP trained with the real brain noise dataset is 60 times faster and is comparable in accuracy to random-20-start-LM, and this hybrid system (localization error: 0.28 cm, computation time: 36 ms) shows almost as good performance as optimal-1-start-LM (localization error: 0.23 cm, computation time: 22 ms), which initializes LM with the correct dipole location.

This report describes a finite element study of tool temperatures in cutting that accounts for tool nose radius and included angle effects. A temperature correction factor model that can be used in the design and selection of inserts is developed to account for these effects. A parametric mesh generator is used to generate the finite element models of tool and inserts of varying geometries. The steady-state temperature response is calculated using NASTRAN solver. Several finite element analysis (FEA) runs are performed to quantify the effects of inserts included angle, nose radius, and materials for the insert and the tool holder on the cutting temperature at the insert rake face. The FEA results are then utilized to develop a temperature correction factor model that accounts for these effects. The temperature correction factor model is integrated with an analytical temperature model for rectangular inserts to predict cutting temperatures for contour turning with inserts of various shapes and nose radii.

(1) An additional level of natural selection is introduced to simulate the effect of natural selection when sperm cells compete to fertilize an ovule; this dramatically improves the offspring survival rate. A conventional GA is analogous to intracytoplasmic sperm injection and has an extremely low offspring survival rate, resulting in very slow convergence.

The main point of the design for LIPCA is to replace the heavy metal layers of THUNDER TM by lightweight fiber reinforced plastic layers without losing the capabilities for generating high force and large displacement. It is possible to save up to about 40% of the weight if we replace the metallic backing material by the light fiber composite layer. We can also have design flexibility by selecting the fiber direction and the size of prepreg layers. In addition to the lightweight advantage and design flexibility, the proposed device can be manufactured without adhesive layers when we use an epoxy resin prepreg system. Glass\/epoxy prepregs, a ceramic wafer with electrode surfaces, and a carbon prepreg were simply stacked and cured at an elevated temperature (177 degrees C) after following an autoclave bagging process. We found that the manufactured composite laminate device had a sufficient curvature after being detached from a flat mould. An analysis method using the classical lamination theory is presented to predict the curvature of LIPCA after curing at an elevated temperature. The predicted curvatures are in quite good agreement with the experimental values.

{"id":"1218","title":"Knowledge acquisition for expert systems in accounting and financial problem domains","abstract":"Since the mid-1980s, expert systems have been developed for a variety of problems in accounting and finance. The most commonly cited problems in developing these systems are the unavailability of the experts and knowledge engineers and difficulties with the rule extraction process. Within the field of artificial intelligence, this has been called the 'knowledge acquisition' (KA) problem and has been identified as a major bottleneck in the expert system development process. Recent empirical research reveals that certain KA techniques are significantly more efficient than others in helping to extract certain types of knowledge within specific problem domains. This paper presents a mapping between these empirical studies and a generic taxonomy of expert system problem domains. To accomplish this, we first examine the range of problem domains and suggest a mapping of accounting and finance tasks to a generic problem domain taxonomy. We then identify and describe the most prominent KA techniques employed in developing expert systems in accounting and finance.

{"id":"790","title":"Data assimilation of local model error forecasts in a deterministic model","abstract":"One of the most popular data assimilation techniques in use today are of the Kalman filter type, which provide an improved estimate of the state of a system up to the current time level, based on actual measurements. From a forecasting viewpoint, this corresponds to an updating of the initial conditions. The standard forecasting procedure is to then run the model uncorrected into the future, driven by predicted boundary and forcing conditions. The problem with this methodology is that the updated initial conditions quickly 'wash-out', thus, after a certain forecast horizon the model predictions are no better than from an initially uncorrected model. This study demonstrates that through the assimilation of error forecasts (in the present case made using so-called local models) entire model domains can be corrected for extended forecast horizons (i.e. long after updated initial conditions have become washed-out), thus demonstrating significant improvements over the conventional methodology. Some alternate uses of local models are also explored for the re-distribution of error forecasts over the entire model domain, which are then compared with more conventional Kalman filter type schemes","tok_text":"data assimil of local model error forecast in a determinist model \n one of the most popular data assimil techniqu in use today are of the kalman filter type , which provid an improv estim of the state of a system up to the current time level , base on actual measur . from a forecast viewpoint , thi correspond to an updat of the initi condit . the standard forecast procedur is to then run the model uncorrect into the futur , driven by predict boundari and forc condit . the problem with thi methodolog is that the updat initi condit quickli ' wash-out ' , thu , after a certain forecast horizon the model predict are no better than from an initi uncorrect model . thi studi demonstr that through the assimil of error forecast ( in the present case made use so-cal local model ) entir model domain can be correct for extend forecast horizon ( i.e. long after updat initi condit have becom washed-out ) , thu demonstr signific improv over the convent methodolog . some altern use of local model are also explor for the re-distribut of error forecast over the entir model domain , which are then compar with more convent kalman filter type scheme","ordered_present_kp":[0,16,48,138,459,581],"keyphrases":["data assimilation","local model error forecasts","deterministic model","Kalman filter","forcing conditions","forecast horizon","error prediction","hydrodynamic modelling"],"prmu":["P","P","P","P","P","P","R","M"]}

The main objective is to extend the application of these algorithms to surfaces with sharp edges and comers. In order to deal with objects of different length scales, the initial background grids are created using a Delaunay triangulation method and local voxelizations. A point enrichment technique that introduces points into the background grid along detected surface features such as ridges is used to ensure that these features are preserved in the final merged surface. The surface merging methodology is extended to include other Boolean operations between surface triangulations. The iso-surface extraction algorithms are modified to obtain the correct iso-surface for multi-component objects. The procedures are demonstrated with various examples, ranging from simple geometrical entities to complex engineering applications. The present algorithms allow realistic modelling of a large number of complex engineering geometries using overlapping components defined discretely, i.e. via surface triangulations.

Effectively extracting data from such documents remains a nontrivial task. In this paper, we present a schema-guided approach to extracting data from HTML pages. Under the approach, the user defines a schema specifying what to be extracted and provides sample mappings between the schema and the HTML page. The system will induce the mapping rules and generate a wrapper that takes the HTML page as input and produces the required data in the form of XML conforming to the user-defined schema.

To replace the sensor the information on the rotor speed is extracted from measured stator voltages and currents at the motor terminals.

Open-loop estimators or closed-loop observers are used for this purpose. They differ with respect to accuracy, robustness, and sensitivity against model parameter variations.

The parallel problem of detecting changes in variance has had less attention.

We describe a procedure that is exact for the distribution of the likelihood ratio statistic for all even degrees of freedom, and gives upper and lower bounds for odd (and also for non-integer) degrees of freedom. Both the liberal and conservative bounds for chi \/sub 1\/\/sup 2\/ degrees of freedom are shown through simulation to be reasonably tight. The important problem of testing for change in the normal variance of individual observations corresponds to the chi \/sub 1\/\/sup 2\/ case.
